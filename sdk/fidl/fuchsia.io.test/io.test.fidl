// TODO(https://fxbug.dev/42109125): Implement full testing framework. For now, we are
// hard-coding the desired directory layout manually in separate "Get"
// functions. In the next step, we would want to have a protocol to describe
// the intended directory layout setup, and integrate io2 connections.

/// Conformance test harnesses will implement this protocol to setup its
/// associated filesystem servers with the described directory layout,
/// allowing their implementation of `fuchsia.io` and `fuchsia.io2` protocols
/// to be verified by a common test suite.
///
/// Different test cases will not interact with one another during the
/// conformance test, and only one test case will be active at a time per
/// tested filesystem. So it is possible to host all cases as different
/// sub-directories under a common filesystem instance, to simplify the
/// lifecycle and implementation.
///
/// If a test case has mutable bits, each method call should be implemented
/// to obtain the directory in its original state. In other words, repeated
/// test case set up should "as-if" yield new directories.
///
/// See `src/storage/conformance/README.md` for an overview of io conformance
/// testing.
///
/// `Io1Config` lets the test harness modulate the set of expected outcomes and
/// behaviors validated by the test suite, by declaring specific properties
/// about the filesystem implementation. For example, setting [`ImmutableFile`]
/// to true informs the test suites that files hosted by this harness do not
/// support mutation.
