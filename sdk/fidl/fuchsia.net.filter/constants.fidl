/// The largest number of changes that can be provided in a single call to
/// `PushChanges`, or events that will be provided in a single `Watch` response.
//
// This limit was chosen by calculating the maximum number of `Event`s or
// `Change`s that could be sent in a single FIDL message while staying within
// the maximum message size enforced by the bindings.
//
// At the time of writing, FIDL messages are limited to 64 KiB. In the current
// FIDL wire format, the size of each `Event` is 1536 bytes (larger than a
// `Change`), and the fixed overhead of the `Watch` reponse is 32 bytes (16 for
// the FIDL message header + 16 for the vector), so we selected the maximum N
// where 32 + N * 1536 <= 64 KiB.
