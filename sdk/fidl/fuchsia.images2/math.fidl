/// An integral, rectangular, axis-aligned region in a 2D cartesian
/// space, with unsigned location and distance fields.

/// This type does not specify units. Protocols that use this type should
/// specify the characteristics of the vector space, including orientation and
/// units.
//
// Some non-protocol types in this library are used by libmagma, which ships in
// the IDK and must be built at all API levels supported by the IDK. See
// https://fxbug.dev/42085119. ImageFormat is one of those types and relies on
// fuchsia.math.RectU which is only available at HEAD. For other API levels,
// use the definition of RectU that existed before https://fxrev.dev/796842.
