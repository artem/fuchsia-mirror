// The |DriverRegistration| is the ABI for drivers to expose themselves to the Driver Framework.
// The driver is loaded in as a shared library (also referred to as a DSO), and the global symbol
// `__fuchsia_driver_registration__` is used by the Driver Framework to locate this
// DriverRegistration in the driver library. The framework will use this to initiate a FIDL based
// connection over the driver transport into the driver.

    // |fdf::UnownedSynchronizedDispatcher| as the driver host is the owner of the dispatcher.

    // the driver should begin serving on. This should be served on the driver dispatcher
    // that this function is executed on.
