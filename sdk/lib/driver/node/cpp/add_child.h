// The following functions can be used to add various types of child nodes to a parent node.
// There are two main types of nodes, owned and un-owned.
//
// Owned: An owned node belongs to the driver creating it, so the driver framework will not try to
// match it up to another driver. Therefore when you create an owned node, you must maintain the
// connection to the node by holding on to the client end.
//
// Un-owned: These are nodes that are not owned by the creating driver. The driver framework will
// go through the driver matching process to find a matching driver, and start the matched driver
// and bind it to the node. The node can provide resources to the bound driver through its offers.
//
// Once the type of node being created is chosen, the next step is to choose whether the node
// should export itself into devfs. The driver framework team is currently in the process of
// deprecating devfs in favor of service capabilities, but until that solution is available, devfs
// is how non-driver components can connect to driver provided protocols. If your node needs to
// provide devfs support, that is available through the variants that support the DevfsAddArgs.
