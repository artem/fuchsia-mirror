Description:

mypy is static typing for Python


Changes made to Work with Fuchsia:

* Added main.py, which is necessary for python_binary template.
* `setup_mypy.py` unzips the mypy for use by other Python tools within
  Fuchsia's build environment.


To update mypy and dependencies, follow these steps:

* Change the mypy version number in the
  `integration/third_party/pylibs/requirements.txt` file.
* Run `integration/third_party/pylibs/update-pylibs.sh` script which updates
  the transitive deps.
* checkout mypy source code to the updated revision in pylibs
  ```
  cd third_party/pylibs/mypy/src/mypy
  git checkout <revision_ID_from_pylibs>
  fx build
  # Make sure build was sucessfull and run mypy.pyz
  fuchsia-vendored-python out/default/obj/third_party/pylibs/mypy/mypy.pyz -h
  ```
* To get list of source files added to python_library("mypy_lib") build run:
  ```
  cd third_party/pylibs/mypy/src/mypy
  find . \( -name "*.py" -o -name "*.pyi" \) ! -path  "*test/*"
  ```
