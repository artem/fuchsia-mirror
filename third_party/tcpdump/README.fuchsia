Description: A tool for network monitoring.
Local Modifications:
  - See https://fxbug.dev/42165274.
  - Add a custom test suite under `tests`.
  - Rename VERSION file to RELEASE_VERSION in response to an issue similar to
    https://bugs.fuchsia.dev/p/fuchsia/issues/detail?id=88184#c6. This is to
    avoid issues with case-insensitive filesystems as the C++ standard library
    includes the line `#include <version>` in various headers.
  - (Googlers only) Absorb upstream changes using the script found at
    //vendor/google/connectivity/network/third_party/libpcap_tcpdump/update_tcpdump.sh.
