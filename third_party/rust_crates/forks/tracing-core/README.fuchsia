Description:

# What is this crate used for?

This is a dependency of the `tracing` crate.

# Are there any use restrictions? i.e. only for development hosts

No.

# What differs from upstream?

We vendor the exact crate but remove the included copies of spin which are only
used in no_std environments. If upstream stops shipping vendored code with
different licenses which won't be used in our build from the main crate, we can
un-fork (see https://fxbug.dev/42082971). This should happen when
https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/issues/492 is resolved.

# Are there any restrictions to how it should be rolled?

No.

# Is there anything else which makes this dependency "special"?

No.
