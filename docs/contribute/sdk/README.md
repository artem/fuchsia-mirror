# Fuchsia SDK Contributor Guide

This section includes documentation for contributing to the [Fuchsia API
Surface][fuchsia-api-surface] and the [IDK].

_Technically_, it may be more appropriate to call this the "IDK Contributor
Guide", as the APIs and libraries that make up the API Surface are first added
to the IDK, which is then turned into an SDK distribution. However,
colloquially and in code, we almost exclusively say "the SDK". Regardless, if
you're looking to "change the SDK" in some way, you're probably in the right
place.

## Contributing to an API in the SDK

To contribute to the [Fuchsia API Surface][fuchsia-api-surface], do the
following:

* Evaluate whether your change is large or small.

  * If you have a small, incremental change to the API, contribute your
      change by completing the steps in
      [Create a change in Gerrit][create-a-change-in-gerrit], as you would for
      any Fuchsia source code change.
  * If you have a large change to the API, that is, a change that
      significantly expands on the function of the API or modifies the
      API extensively, do the following:

    * Create an [RFC][rfc] that explains the design of your modification
         to the API.
    * This RFC should be reviewed through the normal
      [RFC process][rfc-process]. The API reviewer for the relevant area should
      be a stakeholder in the RFC. See the
      [Fuchsia API Council Charter][api-council] to identify API reviewers.
    * After your API RFC is approved, contribute your change by completing the
      steps in [Create a change in Gerrit][create-a-change-in-gerrit], as you
      would for any Fuchsia source code change.

* [Request a code review][request-a-code-review] from an API council member.
  Select your API council reviewer based on the area of the Fuchsia API that
  you're modifying. For a list of API council members and their areas of focus,
  see [Membership][membership] in the Fuchsia API Council Charter.

## Promoting an API to the `partner_internal` category

For an API to be included in the Fuchsia SDK in the `partner_internal`
[SDK category][sdk-category], it must follow the
[API evolution guidelines][evolve-gracefully] which is focused on enabling API
evolution while maintaining compatibility.

Keep in mind that there are additional considerations when promoting an API to
partner, which may reveal tradeoff decisions between compatibility and long term
usability.

Once the API is ready for review, request an API Calibration by filling out this
form: [goto.google.com/fuchsia-api-calibration-request][calibration-form]
indicating that this API is targeting the `partner_internal` category.

If you don't have access to that form, send an email to
api-council@fuchsia.dev indicating the specific library or libraries you'd
like to promote, and the API council will follow up with next steps.

## Promoting an API to the `partner` category

For an API to be included in the Fuchsia SDK in the `partner`, or `public`
[SDK category][sdk-category], it must clear two hurdles: there must be a ready
and willing customer, and the API must have gone through
[API calibration][calibration].

To request an API Calibration, fill out this form:
[goto.google.com/fuchsia-api-calibration-request][calibration-form].
