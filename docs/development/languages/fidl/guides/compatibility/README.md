# FIDL binary-compatibility (ABI) and source-compatibility (API) guide

This guide predated both FIDL versioning (API levels using `@available`) and
unknown interactions (`open` protocols and `flexible` methods). It gave poor
guidance that didn't reflect current policy or best practice. We hope to
eventually provide new, accurate instructions for platform interface evolution.
