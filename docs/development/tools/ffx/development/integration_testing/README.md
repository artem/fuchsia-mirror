# Integration testing

Since `ffx` is primarily designed for developers, it inspects the current environment
for configuration and starts a daemon in the background to coordinate communication
with Fuchsia devices. This makes it more complex to write automated tests that use
`ffx` since the configuration and daemon should be isolated in order to avoid side
effects between tests, or interference from the global environment.

To remedy this, `ffx` can run in an isolated environment for usage within
integration tests.

## Manual isolate setup

To achieve this isolation, `ffx` supports using _isolation directories_. This feature
specifies a new isolated environment for `ffx` to run in, including a user level
configuration. The `ascendd` socket, which is the connection to the `ffx` daemon, is
also created in this directory.

All `ffx` invocations which use an isolate must specify it on the `ffx` commandline with
the `--isolate-dir` option. This can also be specified by setting the `__FFX_ISOLATE_DIR__`
environment variable.

The following pseudo-shell script details configuration steps and commands to
ensure `ffx` is hermetic:

```sh
# Write all configuration and state to the isolate directory, using mktemp or
# something similar.
export FFX_ISOLATE_DIR = ...

# Disable analytics:
ffx config set ffx.analytics.disabled true
# Don't discover devices via mDNS:
ffx config set discovery.mdns.enabled false
# Don't discover fastboot devices connected via USB:
ffx config set fastboot.usb.disabled true
# Require manual process management for the daemon:
ffx config set daemon.autostart false

# If needed, start daemon:
# ffx outputs log files under $FUCHSIA_TEST_OUTDIR/ffx_logs by default.
LOG_DIR = "$FUCHSIA_TEST_OUTDIR/ffx_logs"
# Redirect stdout and stderr to the log file
ffx daemon start > "$LOG_DIR/ffx.daemon.log" 2> "$LOG_DIR/ffx.daemon.log" &

# If interacting with a device:
ffx config target.default "$FUCHSIA_DEVICE_ADDR"
ffx target add "$FUCHSIA_DEVICE_ADDR"
```

When the test is completed, the test author needs to clean up the isolate directory. Deleting
the directory shuts down the daemon; `ffx daemon stop` is recommended but not required. Killing
the daemon process is not recommended as it may leave out information in the log file.

## In-tree Rust isolate library

In the Fuchsia source tree, developers using the Rust programming language should use
[`//src/developer/ffx/lib/isolate`][ffx-lib-isolate] in their test to create and interact
with the isolate directory.

The isolate library automatically follows the manual setup guidelines above and cleans up
the isolate directory on drop.

### Initialize the global context for a test

To avoid initializing the global context from the host environment, tests need to create
a test environment to initialize the global data. The environment is cleaned up when the
return value is dropped, so it must be in scope for the life of the test.

```rust
let test_env = ffx_config::test_init().await?;
```

### Create the isolate

There are two methods to create a new Isolate, depending on the environment
that ffx will operate. For tests that run as part of the in-tree test and
rely on the build output directory structure, use `Isolate::new_in_test()`.
For tests that are part of a ffx subtool, or SDK based, use
`Isolate::new_in_sdk()`.
If the test is interacting with externally provisioned devices, the path to the
_SSH private key_ should be passed in as well. If the testÂ is initializing the
device or starting an emulator, SSH keys will be generated as needed, but a
path to where to store the keys is needed to be configured after the isolate
is created.

The isolate directory is cleaned up when the isolate is dropped,
so it must live for the entire test.

#### Example Isolate::new_in_test()

```rust
  let test_case_name = "my test";
  let ssh_path = std::env::var("FUCHSIA_SSH_KEY").unwrap().into();
  let test_env = ffx_config::test_init().await
      .expect("Setting up test environment");
  // This takes advantage of knowing that Rust tests are down one level from the
  // build output root directory.
  let build_root =
        std::env::current_exe().unwrap().canonicalize().unwrap().parent().unwrap().to_owned();
  let isolate = ffx_isolate::Isolate::new_in_test(test_case_name,
                                                  build_root,
                                                  ssh_path,
                                                  &test_env.context).await
            .expect("create isolate");
```

#### Example Isolate::new_in_sdk()

```rust
  let test_case_name = "my test";
  let ssh_path = std::env::var("FUCHSIA_SSH_KEY").unwrap().into();
  let test_env = ffx_config::test_init().await
      .expect("Setting up test environment");
  let isolate = ffx_isolate::Isolate::new_with_sdk(test_case_name, ssh_path, &test_env.context)
            .await
            .expect("create isolate");
```

### Starting the ffx daemon

The `ffx` daemon must be started manually via the `Isolate::start_daemon()` method. Not
all commands depend on the daemon, and some commands (like `ffx config set`) may need to
be run before starting the daemon.

```rust
let _ = isolate.start_daemon().await?;
```

NOTE: Running `ffx daemon start` directly will not start a functional daemon.

### Running ffx commands

To run commands in the context of the isolate, the `Isolate::ffx()` method is used.
This wrapper adds the correct options to the ffx command line to use the isolate directory.

```rust {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
let output = isolate.ffx(&["target", "list"]).await?;
```

### Configuration inside the isolate

Configuring values and defaults for `ffx` inside the isolate is done using the `ffx config`
commandline:

```rust {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
let args = ["config", "set", "ssh.pub", &path_to_ssh_authorized_keys.to_string_lossy()];
let output = isolate.ffx(&args).await?;
```

### Log files

The log file path for `ffx` when using an isolate is configured when the isolate is created.
A common practice is for the test framework to set the environment variable
`__FUCHSIA_TEST_OUTDIR__` for files that need to be accessible as output from the test. The
log directory is created in a subdirectory of `__FUCHSIA_TEST_OUTDIR__` if it is configured.
The path to the log directory is accessed with `log_dir()`.

```rust {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
let log_dir = isolate.log_dir();
```

### Default target

Some test frameworks may allocate a device for a test to run. The isolate reads the
`__FUCHSIA_DEVICE_ADDR__` environment variable and sets it as the default target in the
configuration.

Note: A side effect of providing the `FUCHSIA_DEVICE_ADDR` value is that `mdns` discovery
of devices is disabled in the `ffx` daemon to improve isolation.

### Analytics configuration

The isolate disables analytics collection via configuration.
