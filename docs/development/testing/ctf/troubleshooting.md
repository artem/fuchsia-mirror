# Troubleshooting failures

This guide provides an overview of common scenarios encountered when
troubleshooting Compatibility Test for Fuchsia (CTF) test failures
and walks through some reasons for breakages and ways to unblock
CL submission.

CTF tests assert on interactions between software frozen on a release
branch and software built on the `main` branch of `fuchsia.git`.
If those assertions fail due to an incompatibility, CL submission
will be blocked.

The purpose of CTF is not to ban compatibility-breaking changes,
rather it is meant to make such breakages visible so that they can
be appropriately addressed.

## Scenarios

In each scenario, a real compatibility issue is introduced which
causes a CTF test to fail and block CL submission. The compatibility
issue can be as simple as changing the return value of an existing
FIDL protocol used by a test.  We assume the following context
common to each scenario (see [motivation] for more testing scenarios):

- A FIDL client is frozen as a `ctf_fuchsia_package` on F19 called
  `echo-service-tests`. This connects to a FIDL protocol and asserts
  on the responses.

- [`generate_ctf_tests.gni`][generate_ctf_tests] contains a rule
  `template("generate_echo-service-tests")` which merges the incoming
  client package with a server package built on `main`. (see the
  user guide for details).

- The client calls a method on the server called `Echo` which takes
  as input a string and returns as output a string as follows:

  ```c++
  auto server_proxy = connect_to_named_protocol("my_protocol.EchoService");
  ASSERT_EQ(
    server_proxy.echo("Hello"),
    "Hello"
  );
  ```

Suppose we want to change the behavior of echo to instead return the
*lowercase* representation of the string it is passed. We can update
our test on `main` to do the following:

```c++
ASSERT_EQ(
  server_proxy.echo("Hello"),
  "hello"
);
```

This passes for `ctf_in_development` tests, but when the frozen
client with the old assertion is run against this new server, the
test will fail:

```bash
FAILURE: "hello" != "Hello"
```

CL submission is now blocked, and the path forward depends on the reason
for this breakage.

### Unintentional breaking change - soft transition

In this scenario, we do not intend to break compatibility. This is the case
if pre-built or out-of-tree components depend on the old behavior. Running
those components against a platform containing the changes to `Echo` will
result in unexpected behavior.

In this case, the safe thing to do is a soft transition to the new behavior:

1. Introduce a new method with the new behavior:

   ```fidl
   protocol Echo {
    // ...
    @available(added=20)
    EchoLowercase(struct {input string}) -> (string);
   };
   ```

1. Mark the old method as deprecated or removed (optional):

   ```fidl
   protocol Echo {
    @available(removed=20)
    Echo(/* ... */) -> (string);
    // ...
   };
   ```
1. Implement the new method in the server.

1. Change `fuchsia.git` callers to use the new method instead of
   the old one.

The server must support both methods until all API levels in which
the old method exists are no longer supported. In the above example,
this will be when F19 is unsupported, since the old Echo method is
removed in F20 (due to `@available(removed=20)`).

### Intentional breaking change - change test in release branch

In this scenario, the compatibility breakage is intentional. This
may arise for several reasons:

- We want to change the behavior of an API, and we accept the risk
  of pre-built or out-of-tree clients breaking. This is a *true
  positive* failure, which we will explicitly acknowledge.

- The behavior that changed is internal to a test, and does not
  represent a breaking change of the SDK surface itself. This is a
  *false positive* failure, because we caught a test incompatibility
  rather than an SDK incompatibility.

In either case, the solution is to modify the release branch so
that the test will no longer fail when run against either the
pre-change or post-change code on `main`.

The change can be made as follows:

1. Check out the release branch:

   ```bash
   fx sync-to refs/heads/releases/{{ '<var>' }}f19{{ '</var>' }}
   ```

1. Modify the assertion so it accepts both outputs (or comment it out):

   ```c++
  EXPECT_THAT(
    server_proxy.echo("Hello"),
    AnyOf(Eq("Hello"), Eq("hello"))
  );
   ```
1. Test that your changes will work on `main` (see below)

1. Commit and push changes:

   ```bash
   git push origin HEAD:refs/for/releases/{{ '<var>' }}f19{{ '</var>' }}
   ```
1. Get CL reviewed and submit.

1. Land the blocked CL.

1. Clean up the release branch to accept only the new behavior (optional).

   ```c++
   EXPECT_EQ(
     server_proxy.echo("Hello"),
     "hello"
   );
   ```

You can test that your changes will work when applied to `main`.
You need two checkouts of Fuchsia, one synced to the release branch
and one synced to `main`. Do the following:

1. On the **release branch** checkout, build a new CTF bundle.

   ```bash
   fx set core.x64 --with-tests //sdk/ctf
   fx build
   ```

1. On the **`main`** checkout, build the CTF release tests.

   ```bash
   fx set core.x64 --with-tests //sdk/ctf/release:tests
   fx build
   ```
1. In the output directory for the **release branch**, copy the
   built CTF bundle to the **`main`** repository.

   ```bash
   cp -fR \
   {{ '<var>' }}$RELEASE_BRANCH_FUCHSIA_OUT_DIR{{ '</var>' }}/cts/* \
   {{ '<var>' }}$MAIN_BRANCH_FUCHSIA_DIR{{ '</var>' }}/prebuilt/ctf/{{ '<var>' }}f19{{ '</var>' }}/linux-x64/cts/
   ```

1. Rebuild the **`main`** checkout, repave device or restart
   emulator, and run the tests.

1. Revert back to the version from CIPD once tests pass.

   ```bash
   jiri run-hooks
   ```

#### Example: SDK compatibility breakage (true positive)

https://fxrev.dev/1041178 introduced a real compatibility breakage
to `fuchsia.ui.policy.MediaButtonsListener` protocol. A new parameter
was added to the `MediaButtonsEvent` with correct versioning
annotations, however, the behavior if that parameter is left empty
changed from the previous implementation. This incompatibility was
caught by the CTF test for F19:

```
../../src/ui/tests/conformance_input_tests/media-button-validator.cc:243: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
  ToString(listener.events_received()[0])
    Which is: "\n    volume: 0\n    mic_mute: 0\n    pause: 0\n    camera_disable: 0\n    power: 0"
  ToString(MakePowerEvent())
    Which is: "\n    volume: 0\n    mic_mute: 0\n    pause: 0\n    camera_disable: 0\n    power: 1"
```

It was determined that this change is acceptable because there are
not any pre-built clients of this protocol targeting API level 19.

CLs https://fxrev.dev/1044994 and https://fxrev.dev/1049612 were
cherry-picked into the F19 release branch using the instructions
above. Once the changes were rolled into the CTF release used on
`main`, the original CL was submitted without modification.

#### Example: Test harness compatibility breakage (false positive)

https://fxrev.dev/1007583 introduced a compatibility breakage to
the `fuchsia.tracing.controller.Controller` protocol. The `StopTracing`
method was made `flexible`, and changing a method from `strict` to
`flexible` is not ABI-safe.

The WLAN hw-sim CTF test crashes under this change because it asserts
that tracing successfully stops during the test, even though this
is unrelated to the tested WLAN protocols and is not needed for
correctness. This is a false positive compatibility failure because
it affects only the test harness itself.

https://fxrev.dev/1014607 was landed to turn tracing failures into
warnings rather than fatal assertions, and this change was cherry-picked
to the F18 release branch. Once the change was rolled into the CTF
release used on `main`, the original CL was submitted without
modification.

### Intentionally drop support for an API level for specific tests

In this scenario, we want to explicitly drop support for an API
level on a per-test basis.  While [`version_history.json`][version_history]
provides the canonical listing of supported API levels, there are
reasons we would want to drop compatibility guarantees for specific
protocols on a specific API level. For example, a major refactor
of a non-critical subsystem where breaking old clients is acceptable.

In this case, we can take modify the thawing process to skip tests
targeting the API level we want to drop:

1. Modify [`generate_ctf_tests.gni`][generate_ctf_tests] on the `main`
   branch to conditionally skip thawing the test.

   ```gn
   template("generate_my-service-tests") {
    forward_variables_from(invoker, [ "test_info" ])
    if (defined(invoker.api_level) && invoker.api_level == "15") {
      # Do not thaw this test for F15
      not_needed([ "test_info" ])
      group(target_name) {
      }
    } else {
      // ...
    }
   }
   ```

1. Commit and submit this CL.

The above example skips thawing the entire artifact at F15. If you
do not want to skip all tests, see the previous section for how to
skip individual test cases on the release branch.

### Example: Major refactor to diagnostics subsystem

https://fxrev.dev/1019042 deleted support for the `DirectoryReady`
component event, which is no longer in use. Its primary use was to
support obtaining diagnostics data from components (which is now
published using the `fuchsia.inspect.InspectSink`) protocol.

Unfortunately, components built at F15 still published their
diagnostics using `DirectoryReady`, and all diagnostics CTF tests
of this behavior would fail on `main` following its removal.

Fortunately, there are no pre-built components targeting F15 for
which we need to obtain diagnostics data. A CL was submitted to
[disable][disable-cl] all diagnostics CTF tests originating in F15.
