# Drivers

Fuchsia’s driver framework is a collection of libraries, tools, metadata, and
components that enable developers to create, run, test, and distribute drivers for
Fuchsia systems. The driver framework aims to provide a stable ABI that allows
developers to write a driver once and deploy it on multiple versions of the Fuchsia
platform. (However, Fuchsia's driver framework is constantly evolving and has not
achieved ABI stability yet.)

The driver framework is composed of the driver manager, driver hosts, libraries,
FIDL interfaces, Banjo interfaces, and a set of guidelines for developing drivers
for Fuchsia:

- The **driver manager** is responsible for managing the life cycle of drivers,
  such as loading, unloading, and registering. It also provides ways for drivers
  to communicate with each other and with Fuchsia’s [Zircon][zircon] kernel.
- The **driver host** is a process that runs in the kernel and enables drivers to
  access kernel resources.
- The **driver runtime** is an in process library which facilitates communication
  and event handling.
- The **FIDL** interfaces are used for communication between drivers and the rest of
  the system.
- \[**DFv1 only**\] The **core library** (`libdriver`) provides a set of common functions
  that DFv1 drivers can use to interact with the driver manager and driver host.
- \[**DFv1 only**\] The **Banjo** interfaces are used for communication between drivers
  and the driver manager.

  (For more information on the differences between DFv1 and DFv2, see
  [Comparison between DFv1 and DFv2][dfv1-and-dfv2].)

For more details on these concepts for the new driver framework (DFv2), see
the [Drivers][dfv2-concepts] section under _Fundamentals_.
