## fi-0212: Renamed without replaced or removed {:#fi-0212}

The `@available` argument `renamed` is not allowed on its own. It must be used
together with the `replaced` or `removed` argument:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0212.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

If you just want to rename the element at version `N`, use `replaced=N` and
define a replacement with the new name marked `added=N`:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0212-a.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

In this case, the replacement method must override `@selector` for ABI
compatibility.

Alternatively, if you want to remove the element at version `N` and refer to it
by a different name after its removal, use `removed=N`:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0212-b.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

In this case, the new name will only be used when targeting multiple versions
(e.g. `--available test:1,2`) since that is the only way to include the element
while also targeting a version past its removal.
