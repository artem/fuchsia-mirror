## fi-0217: Invalid `@available(replaced=N)` (ABI) {:#fi-0217}

This is like [fi-0206: Invalid `@available(replaced=N)`](#fi-0206), but for when
a replacement is only found matching the element's name, not its ABI:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0217.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

If you intended to replace the element, make sure its ABI matches. In this case,
we can remove the `@selector` attribute since both methods already have the same
name:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0217-a.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

If you did not intend to replace the ABI, use `removed` instead of `replaced`.
In this case, we also have to choose a different name to avoid clashing with the
old one:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0217-b.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

If you really want to reuse the name but not the ABI, use `removed` instead of
`replaced`, and also use `renamed` to rename the old element post-removal,
freeing up its original name:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0217-c.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

This error can occur for other members, not just methods. For bits and enum
members, the ABI is the integer value. For struct members, the ABI is the byte
offset. For table and union members, the ABI is the ordinal.
