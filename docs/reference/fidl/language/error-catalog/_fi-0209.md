## fi-0209: Reserved fields are not allowed {:#fi-0209}

FIDL no longer supports `reserved` table or union fields:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0209.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

The main purpose of reserved fields was to avoid accidental reuse of ordinals.
With [FIDL versioning](/docs/reference/fidl/language/versioning.md), that is no
longer an issue. You can annotate old fields `@available(removed=N)` while
keeping them (and their ordinals) in the source file:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0209-a.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Another use of `reserved` was to document the intended future use of an ordinal.
In that case, consider defining the field at the unstable API level `HEAD`:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0209-b.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

For any other uses of `reserved`, consider leaving a comment instead:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0209-c.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```
