## fi-0203: Removed and replaced are mutually exclusive {:#fi-0203}

The `@available` attribute supports the arguments `removed` and `replaced`, but
they can't be used together:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0203.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

To fix the error, delete one of the arguments. If you intend to remove the
element without replacing it, keep `removed` and delete `replaced`:

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0203-a.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Alternatively, if you are [swapping] the element with a new definition, keep
`replaced` and delete `removed`:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0203-b.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

It doesn't make sense to use `removed` and `replaced` together because they have
opposite meanings. When an element is marked `removed`, fidlc validates that
there **IS NOT** a replacement element added at the same version. When an
element is marked `replaced`, fidlc validates that there **IS** a replacement
element added at the same version.
