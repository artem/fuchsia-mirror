## fi-0204: Element cannot be replaced {:#fi-0204}

The `@available` attribute's `replaced` argument cannot be used on certain
elements. For example, it cannot be used on a `library` declaration:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0204.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Instead, use the `removed` argument:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0204.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

The `replaced` argument indicates that an element is replaced by a new
definition. This is not supported for the following elements:

* `library`: You can't replace an entire library because the library only has
  one set of files that defines it.
* `compose`: You can't replace a protocol composition because compositions are
  not named. There would be no way to identify the replacement.
