## fi-0211: Element cannot be renamed {:#fi-0211}

The `@available` attribute's `renamed` argument can only be used on members of
declarations, not on declarations themselves:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0211.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Instead of renaming a declaration, remove the old one and add a new one:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/fi-0211.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Renaming is only supported on members because the FIDL compiler can compare
their ABI identity (e.g. table ordinal) to ensure it is done correctly.

The `renamed` argument is also not allowed on the following elements either:

* `library`: You can't rename a library from within because the FIDL toolchain
  assumes each library has a single name. Instead, you should create a new
  library with the desired name and migrate users to it.
* `compose`: You can't rename a protocol composition because compositions are
  not named to begin with.
