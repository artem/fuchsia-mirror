# User guide for Lacewing

This page provides best practices, examples, and reference materials for using
Fuchsia's Lacewing framework for writing host-driven tests (also known as
end-to-end tests or system tests).


## Vision

Lacewing is Fuchsia's unified host-driven testing framework. It's designed to
serve users both in-tree and out-of-tree.

At a high level, Lacewing aims to:

*   Eliminate host-driven test framework fragmentation
*   Improve host-driven test stability and reliability
*   Centralize host-target interaction to versioned and officially supported
    APIs
*   Lower the barrier of entry for host-driven test development
