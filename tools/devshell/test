### Entry point for all Fuchsia tests (host, target and end-to-end)

## Usage: fx test [testName ...]
##
## This is an incomplete list of options. Run 'fx test --help' for the complete set of options.
## Options:
## -h, --help
##     --test-filter                     Runs specific test cases in v2 suite. Can be specified multiple
##                                       times to pass in multiple patterns.
##                                       example: --test-filter glob1 --test-filter glob2
## --restrict-logs, --no-restrict-logs   If false, do not limit maximum log severity regardless of the
##                                       test's configuration. Default is true.
