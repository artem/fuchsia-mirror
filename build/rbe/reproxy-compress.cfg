# Compress remote execution output downloads from RBE.
# This could be very beneficial in bandwith-limited development environments.
# Use of compression increases local CPU usage to some degree in reproxy.
# The threshold of 16k was chosen arbitrarily,
# but gave reasonable results so far.  (This could be tweaked further.)
# `use_batches` must be set to false to net any results.
# To use this, add to your args.gn:
#   rbe_extra_reproxy_configs = [ "//build/rbe/reproxy-compress.cfg" ]
