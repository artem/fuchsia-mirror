This directory contains a number of small starlark files that can be used
in `bazel cquery` invocations to extract information about the Bazel
build graph. For example:

```
fx bazel cquery <config-options>
    --output=starlark --starlark:file=/path/to/this/file \
    //path/to:target
```

They are mostly an implementation detail of the `bazel_action.py`
script. Their content may change arbitrarily to keep track of internal
changes within the Bazel SDK rules.
