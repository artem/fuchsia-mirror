# This file is used to list the names of the GN declare_args() variables
# that need to be exported to Bazel. They will appear as constants in the
# args.bzl file generated by the fuchsia_build_info_repository() rule.
#
# The lint-related comments are important to ensure that the GN files
# where these variables are defined are updated in sync with this file,
# but *also* to generate the content of args.bzl.
#
# The format of each line is simpler: <varname>: <vartype>
# Where <varname> is the GN variable name, and <vartype> is one
# of the following values, describing its type and how the corresponding
# GN value will be mapped to Starlark.
#
#   - bool: A boolean flag, mapped to True or False
#   - string: A string, mapped to a Starlark string, must not include GN expansions.
#   - string_or_false: Either the false boolean value, or a string. Always mapped
#        to a Starlark string (false will be mapped to the empty string).
