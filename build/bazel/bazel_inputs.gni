# A set of GN templates to expose Ninja-generated output files as inputs
# to bazel_action() targets. The latter run a `bazel build` command in
# the Bazel workspace setup by the platform build, which cannot access
# the Ninja output directory directly.
#
# A bazel_input_xxx() target defines a mapping from Ninja-generated outputs
# to files and Bazel filegroup() targets defined in the special repository
# named @legacy_ninja_build_outputs.
#
# For example, to expose the files generated by an action `foo` as a
# filegroup() with Bazel label @legacy_ninja_build_outputs//:foo_files, one
# can use the following definition:
#
# ```gn
#   # Expose all outputs generated by :foo in Bazel.
#   bazel_input_resource("foo_files") {
#    deps = [ ":foo" ]
#    sources = get_target_outputs(":foo")
#    outputs = [ "{{source_file_part}}" ]
#  }
#
# IMPORTANT: Simply defining a bazel_input_xxx() target is NOT ENOUGH, it must
# ALSO be part of the transitive dependencies listed from one of the lists
# defined in //build/bazel/legacy_ninja_build_outputs.gni
#
# There is no way to enforce that with GN at the moment.
#

# Expose a set of Ninja output files as a corresponding Bazel filegroup()
# of prebuilt input sources for the Bazel build.
#
# This template works like copy() or resource().
#
# ```gn
#   # Expose all outputs generated by :foo in Bazel.
#   bazel_input_resource("foo_files") {
#    deps = [ ":foo" ]
#    sources = get_target_outputs(":foo")
#    outputs = [ "{{source_file_part}}" ]
#  }
#
#  ...
#
#  Make sure this is reachable from the transitive dependencies listed in
#  //build/bazel/legacy_ninja_build_outputs.gni, e.g.:
#
# ```
#  gn_labels_for_bazel_inputs += [ "//src/foo:foo_files" ]
# ```
#
# Assuming that :foo generates the following files:
#
#    out/default/gen/src/foo/foo.h
#    out/default/gen/src/foo/foo.cc
#
# Then this will generate something like that @legacy_ninja_build_outputs/BUILD.bazel:
#
# ```bazel
#  filegroup("foo_files") {
#      srcs = [
#        "foo.h",
#        "foo.cc",
#      ]
#  )
# ```
#
# After creating the symlinks as:
#
#  $BAZEL_TOPDIR/output_base/external/legacy_ninja_build_outputs/
#    foo.h --> ../../../../../src/foo/foo.h
#    foo.cc --> ../../../../../src/foo/foo.cc
#
# Arguments:
#   name: (optional)
#     Bazel filegroup name for the set of files covered by this target.
#     If not specified, defaults to target_name. Note that the filegroup()
#     will be part of the top-level BUILD.bazel file generated by the
#     build)_inputs_workspace() dependent. This name cannot contain a
#     directory separator or colon.
#     Type: string
#
#   sources
#     Required: List of output files that become sources in the Bazel
#     workspace. Technically works with Ninja source files as well, but these
#     are already exposed to Bazel by default, and don't need to be
#     listed in a bazel_input_resource() target. See copy() for details.
#     Type: list(file)
#
#   outputs
#     Required: List of one runtime path.  This must be a relative path (no
#     leading `/`).  It can use placeholders based on $sources; see copy()
#     and `gn help source_expansion`.
#     Type: list(path)
#
#   deps
#     Optional: Targets that produce $sources.  Any files listed in
#     $sources that are produced by the build should be produced by a
#     target listed here.
#     Type: list(label)

# bazel_input_resource_directory() is used to expose the content of a Ninja
# output directory as a Bazel input filegroup. Instead of passing a list of
# source files, `source_root` source point to a directory whose content will
# be symlinks into a bazel_build_inputs_workspace().
#
# IMPORTANT: This is not hermetic, and can lead to incorrect results during
# incremental builds, unless the directory's content is always cleared
# before the Ninja action that generates its content is run.
#
# For example:
#
#    bazel_input_resource_directory"my-generated-resources") {
#      source_dir = get_label_info(":resource-generator", "target_gen_dir")

#
#   inputs_deps:
#     A list of targets, all transitive dependencies which are bazel_input_xxx()
#     target will generate one entry in the manifest.

  # resources. Each metadata entry is a scope that describes a single
  # Bazel filegroup() target that will appear at the top of the
  # auto-generated workspace.
  #
  # There are two types of entries:
  #
  # ## REGULAR ENTRIES
  #
  #   These entries expose an explicit list of files, they look like:
  #
  #     name: (required)
  #        Bazel filegroup name.
  #        Type: string
  #
  #     destinations: (required)
  #        List of input files, relative to the top of the generated workspace.
  #        Each one will appear in the `srcs` list of the corresponding
  #        filegroup.
  #
  #     sources: (required)
  #        List of source files for the filegroup. Must have the same
  #        size as the `destinations` list.
  #        Type: list of paths relative to the root_build_dir
  #
  #     gn_label:
  #        GN label of target that defines this entry.
  #        Type: GN label string

  #            ...

  #   Where <destination_N> is the N-th entry in `destinations`, and will be
  #   the path to a symlink (in the repository) to the corresponding
  #   <sources_N> file.
  #
  # ## DIRECTORY ENTRIES
  #
  #   These entries expose all files under a given output directory as
  #   a single filegroup() using the glob() function. IMPORTANT: For
  #   correctness, only use these when it is 100% sure that the content
  #   of the source directory is re-created properly during incremental
  #   builds. These look like:
  #
  #     name: (required)
  #        Bazel filegroup name.
  #        Type: string
  #
  #     source_dir: (required)
  #        A source directory path, relative to the Ninja build output
  #        directory, which will contain all input files for the Bazel
  #        filegroup().
  #
  #     dest_dir: (required)
  #        A directory prefix for all input files, relative to the top of
  #        the generated workspace. This will be a symlink to source_dir,
  #        and the filegroup() will use a glob(["<dest_dir>/*"]) call to get all
  #        files in it.
  #
  #     gn_label: (optional)
  #        GN label of target that defines this entry.
  #        Type: GN label string
  #
  #   They should generate Bazel targets that look like:
  #
  #     filegroup(
  #         name = "<name>",
