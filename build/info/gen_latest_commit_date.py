# This script gets an estimate for the time of the most recent commit from the
# integration repo. This is used at runtime as a known-good lower bound on what
# the current time is for cases in which the clock hasn't yet been updated from
# the network.
#
# We do this by taking the CommitDate of the most recent commit from the
# integration repo. Unlike commits in other repositories, the commits in the
# integration repo are always created by server infrastructure, and thus their
# CommitDate fields are more reliable. This is critical since a backstop time
# which is erroneously in the future could break many applications.
#
# The commit date is then truncated to midnight UTC as the extra granularity
# is not needed for the kernel backstop time and because it causes extra work
# on infra builders.
