LogLevel ERROR

# Zero or more authorized_keys files may be present under different scenarios:
#   /data - authorized_keys are typically read from here when running on hardware, copied into minfs
#           during the paving process.
#   /boot - authorized_keys should only present be in bootfs when running Fuchsia in an emulator.
#   /config/data/authorized_keys - This file is not expected to be present on standard builds, only
#           on those that need to inject keys for special circumstances, such as when being tested
#           from automated infrastructure.
#           See go/fuchsia-ssh-for-testing for more informaton on that.
#
# These are combined since the sshd will only use the first AuthorizedKeysFile line.

# This is an opion specific to the Fuchsia fork which disables validation of the "valid_after" field
# of CA-signed ssh key certificates, so that ssh can be used when the current time has not been able
# to be synced with, and the system is using the backstop time.
