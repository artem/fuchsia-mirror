  # This is an allowlist of test targets that are allowed to set `timeout_secs`
  # to override the infrastructure-enforced per-test timeout.
  #
  # You must receive an exception to override the infrastructure-imposed timeout
  # for a test, because:
  #
  # 1. Slow tests are costly to run and cause higher presubmit latency for
  #    everyone. The first step when trying to get a slow test passing is to
  #    optimize the test. If it turns out to be difficult or impossible to get
  #    the test to run within the infrastructure-imposed timeout, justification
  #    is required for why the test is valuable enough to receive an exception
  #    to the infrastructure-imposed timeout.
  # 2. The runtime of a given test may vary widely depending on the build
  #    configuration. For example, many tests run several times slower with
  #    coverage collection enabled. A hardcoded timeout will be either too short
  #    for slow build configurations, resulting in flaky timeouts, or too long
  #    for fast build configurations, resulting in time wasted waiting for the
  #    test to complete well beyond its expected runtime in case of a hang.
  #
  # Tests that run so slowly that they need an exception from the
  # infrastructure-imposed timeout should consider other options, such as
  # optimizing the test, splitting it into separate test executables, or running
  # the test only in postsubmit on a builder that supports running slower tests.
