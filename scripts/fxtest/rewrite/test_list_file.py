"""Data model and associated methods for test-list.json files.

test-list.json is a post-processed version of tests.json that is
produced by //tools/test_list_tool. It provides basic execution
instructions and categorization for tests that are part of the
Fuchsia build.

test-list.json is typically stored at the root of the output directory
for the Fuchsia build.
