    """Spawn zxdb in a subprocess.

    Spawn zxdb and attach to |tests|, while waiting for a test failure reported by either
    exception or software breakpoint. Standard output for this program is redirected to a fifo,
    which zxdb will stream to the console. The debugger is spawned in a synchronous process since
    zxdb will be handling all of the stdio streams itself and will take control of forwarding IO
    from python back to the console. The caller has no responsibility to deal with any input or
    output from the spawned process.

    Args:
        tests (list[test_list_file.Test]): List of tests selected to be executed.
        on_debugger_ready (typing.Callable): An async closure to be issued when the debugger is
                                             ready for processes to be spawned.
        break_on_failure (bool): Whether or not we are in break-on-failure mode.
        breakpoints (list[str]): List of breakpoint locations to install. Note: this may slow down
                                 test execution significantly.

    Returns:
        subprocess.Popen: process handle for the zxdb process group.

        Note: The caller is responsible for killing the process group associated with the returned
        process.
