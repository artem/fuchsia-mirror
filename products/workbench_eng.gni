# This gni import only exists because we need to build the GN platform artifacts
# before passing them to Bazel. Workbench still has some artifacts which need to
# come from a legacy bundle. It uses the legacy bundle defined for the minimal
# image to minimize the number of legacy bundles we need to maintain. We will
# eventually delete the minimal legacy bundle altogether.
#
# Every new addition to this gni file is an instance of tech-debt that must be
# cleaned up to have a proper platform+product interface. If you need to add a
# specific artifact to the workbench product, please either add it to the bazel
# rules: //products/workbench/BUILD.bazel
#
# or to the platform AIBs: //build/assembly/BUILD.gn
#
# If the artifact is incapable of being put inside either of these locations,
# reach out to the assembly team for guidance: //src/lib/assembly/OWNERS. The
# assembly team may allow an exception so that artifacts can be added directly
# to this file, but each entry needs a ticket assigned to the assembly team with
# an agreed upon solution for how to address the tech-debt.
