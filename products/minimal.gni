# This `minimal` product is intended to be the "smallest thing we'd still call Fuchsia," which
# implies simplicity, security, updatability and performance. Importantly, that differs from "all
# current products use this feature;" today, that is what the `core` product is for.
# `minimal` will change over time, both by addition and subtraction -- for example, should the
# team ship a mechanism for updating Fuchsia that does not require IP networking, that functionality
# should be moved to a higher-level product definition.
