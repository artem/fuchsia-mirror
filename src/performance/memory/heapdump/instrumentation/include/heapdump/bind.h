// Binds the current process to the provided process registry.

// `registry_channel` must be the client end of a `fuchsia.memory.heapdump.process.Registry` channel
// connected to heapdump's collector. Calling this function is necessary to make the current process
// visible to the collector and, in turn, to its `ffx profile heapdump` client commands.
//
// Since a process cannot be bound to multiple registries, this function can only be called at most
// once during the lifetime of a process. This is enforced by the function itself, which will print
// an error and abort if called twice.
//
// Note: Allocations and snapshots captured before calling this function are internally buffered.
// Therefore, while it is expected that programs will call this function as early as possible, no
// data will be lost if they start to allocate before doing so.

// This function wraps `heapdump_bind_with_channel` and implements the common case of using fdio to
// connect to the process registry.
