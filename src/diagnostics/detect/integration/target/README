Since faketime needs a library linked with the binary, as well as some
capabilities routed, the Detect component and binary can't quite be
off-the-shelf. Since the real Detect starts via Launcher, this test
does too, but uses the "bin_with_fake_time" target from
//src/diagnostics/launcher/BUILD.gn.

This directory creates a package that can be included in a hermetic
test as a subpackage.
