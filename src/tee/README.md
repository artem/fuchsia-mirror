# TEE

This directory contains support for hosting a Trusted Execution Environment inside Fuchsia.

## Structure

The `ta` directory contains Trusted Application implementations for testing
purposes.

The `tee_internal_api` directory contains the definition and implementation of
the TEE Internal Core API.

The `runtime` directory contains the TA runtime binary connecting the TEE
bindings with the fuchsia.tee.Application FIDL protocol.

## Glossary

* TEE - Trusted Execution Environment. This is an environment suitable for
executing a TA that should be isolated from less trusted software.

* TA - Trusted Application. Program which executes within a TEE and which may
have access to sensitive resources such as cryptographic keys. A TA performs
computations using these resources on behalf of its client.

* REE - Rich Execution Environment. General purpose computing environment that may contain
less trusted data and software.

* TEE Client API - API used by programs running in the REE to communicate with TAs.

* TEE Internal Core API - API exposed to TAs running in the TEE.
