// TODO(https://fxbug.dev/42140376): For now these protocol definitions are manually defined to match protodefs.h.
// Usually fuchsia.<namespace>.BIND_PROTOCOL.DEVICE would map to ZX_PROTOCOL_<namespace>, but in
// this case it maps to ZX_PROTOCOL_USB_DEVICE. This is because the USB protocol is implemented by
// two kinds of drivers: those that acquire an entire device (ZX_PROTOCOL_USB_DEVICE) and those
// acquire a single interface of the device (ZX_PROTOCOL_USB_INTERFACE). ZX_PROTOCOL_USB is still
// used for the banjo protocol for both kinds of drivers.
