//! The primary purpose of this bedrock module is that tests inside component manager
//! can poke into the bedrock state if needed, and we can ensure that only tests
//! can do so, by marking relevant methods with `#[cfg(test)]`. We also have other
//! bedrock libraries such as `sandbox`. It's likely we'll find the best
//! module/library layout over time.
