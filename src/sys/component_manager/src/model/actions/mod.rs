//! The "Action" concept represents an asynchronous activity on a component that should eventually
//! complete.
//!
//! Actions decouple the "what" of what needs to happen to a component from the "how". Several
//! client APIs may induce operations on a component's state that complete asynchronously. These
//! operations could depend on each other in various ways.
//!
//! A key property of actions is idempotency. If two equal actions are registered on a component,
//! the work for that action is performed only once. This means that two distinct call sites can
//! register the same action, and be guaranteed the work is not repeated.
//!
//! Here are a couple examples:
//! - A `Shutdown` FIDL call must shut down every component instance in the tree, in
//!   dependency order. For this to happen every component must shut down, but not before its
//!   downstream dependencies have shut down.
//! - A `Realm.DestroyChild` FIDL call returns right after a child component is destroyed.
//!   However, in order to actually delete the child, a sequence of events must happen:
//!     * All instances in the component must be shut down (see above)
//!     * The component instance's persistent storage must be erased, if any.
//!     * The component's parent must remove it as a child.
//!
//! Note the interdependencies here -- destroying a component also requires shutdown, for example.
//!
//! These processes could be implemented through a chain of futures in the vicinity of the API
//! call. However, this doesn't scale well, because it requires distributed state handling and is
//! prone to races. Actions solve this problem by allowing client code to just specify the actions
//! that need to eventually be fulfilled. The actual business logic to perform the actions can be
//! implemented by the component itself in a coordinated manner.
//!
//! `DestroyChild()` is an example of how this can work. For simplicity, suppose it's called on a
//! component with no children of its own. This might cause a chain of events like the following:
//!
//! - Before it returns, the `DestroyChild` FIDL handler registers the `DeleteChild` action on the
//!   parent component for child being destroyed.
//! - This results in a call to `Action::handle` for the component. In response to
//!   `DestroyChild`, `Action::handle()` spawns a future that sets a `Destroy` action on the child.
//!   Note that `Action::handle()` is not async, it always spawns any work that might block
//!   in a future.
//! - `Action::handle()` is called on the child. In response to `Destroy`, it sets a `Shutdown`
//!   action on itself (the component instance must be stopped before it is destroyed).
//! - `Action::handle()` is called on the child again, in response to `Shutdown`. It turns out the
//!   instance is still running, so the `Shutdown` future tells the instance to stop. When this
//!   completes, the `Shutdown` action is finished.
//! - The future that was spawned for `Destroy` is notified that `Shutdown` completes, so it cleans
//!   up the instance's resources and finishes the `Destroy` action.
//! - When the work for `Destroy` completes, the future spawned for `DestroyChild` deletes the
//!   child and marks `DestroyChild` finished, which will notify the client that the action is
//!   complete.
