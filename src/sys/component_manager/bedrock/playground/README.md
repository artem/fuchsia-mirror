# Bedrock playground

The bedrock playground is a place to exercise component bedrock APIs in
a simplified environment outside of component manager. It serves as an incubator
to try new types that could eventually be used in component manager that is
faster and easier to iterate upon.

It contains:

* Toy capability router that moves capabilities between sandboxes,
  driven by "component" decls, demonstrating lazy routing and availability
  as a capability transformation.
