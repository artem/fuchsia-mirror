# `component_id_index` library

This library merges and validates component ID index files. It provides a way to
use a custom encoding format (e.g, JSON), along with conversion to/from the FIDL
schema.

This library has 2 clients:
* A build tool which validates and merges component ID index files written in
  JSON5 into a single index, which is written out to a FIDL-encoded index file
  which is used by `component_manager`.
* `component_manager` which consumes a single FIDL-encoded component ID index
  file.

See `//sdk/fidl/fuchsia.component.internal/component_id_index.fidl` for the FIDL
schema.

In order to keep the size of component_manager small, this library does not
directly depend on serde_json and serde_json5. Instead, this library accepts a
decoder implementation which helps decode a JSON/JSON5 string into an Index data
structure.
