# Coding guidelines

[TOC]

## Reasons for creating guidelines
As of Q4 2023, Fuchsia does not automatically enforce coding standards on
Python code and fix/flag the CL during development/review process.

Many teams across Fuchsia (and potentially third party vendors such as driver
development)
1. will be using Lacewing and Honeydew for the testing. So it is of the utmost
   importance to ensure code works reliably
2. will be contributing to Honeydew to add/fix Host-(Fuchsia)Target
   interactions. Some of them may not have prior Python development experience.
   So it is of the utmost importance to ensure code written is consistent and
   meets the readability, quality bar set at Google and Fuchsia

To help facilitate #1, Honeydew relies on having solid unit test and
functional test coverage.

To help facilitate #2, Honeydew relies on [Google Python Style Guide]
(which contains a list of dos and don’ts for Python programs).

## Proposal
### Current State
As of Q4 2023, Fuchsia does not automatically enforce coding standards on
Python code and fix/flag the CL during development/review process.

### End state
All the tools needed to enforce coding standards on Python code will be
integrated into Fuchsia developer workflow and will be run automatically in
CQ/Pre-Submit.

### Interim
Until that point, the Lacewing team has created below guidelines that need to be
followed by everyone while contributing to Honeydew. Following these guidelines
will ensure code is well tested, consistent and readable before it is merged.

We understand it's difficult to meet these requirements without automated
enforcement. Please bear with us while we roll out the appropriate automated
checks.

## What are the guidelines?
- Ensure we have following type of tests
  - Unit test cases
    - Tests individual code units (such as functions) in isolation from the rest
      of the system by mocking all of the dependencies.
    - Makes it easy to test different error conditions, corner cases etc
    - Minimum of 70% of Honeydew code is tested using these unit tests
  - Functional test cases
    - Aims to ensure that a given API works as intended and indeed does what it
      is supposed to do (that is, `<device>.reboot()` actually reboots Fuchsia
      device) which can’t be ensured using unit test cases
    - Every single Honeydew’s Host-(Fuchsia)Target interaction API should have
      at-least one functional test case
- Ensuring code is meeting google’s Python style guide
  - Remove unused Python code using [autoflake]
  - Sort the imports using [isort]
  - Formatting using [black]
  - Linting using [pylint] (static code analysis for Python)
  - Type checking using [mypy] (static type checker for Python)

To ease the development workflow, we have
[automated checking for these guidelines](#How-to-check-for-these-guidelines?)
(everything except functional test cases). Users should run this script and
fix any errors it suggests.


## When to check for these guidelines?
**These guidelines need to be checked at the least on the following patchsets:**
1. Initial patchset just before adding reviewers
2. Final patchset just before merging the CL

On all other patchsets, it is recommended but optional to check these
guidelines.

## How to check for these guidelines?
**Note** - Prior to running this, please make sure to follow
[Setup](interactive_usage.md#Setup)

**Run** `cd $FUCHSIA_DIR && sh $FUCHSIA_DIR/src/testing/end_to_end/honeydew/scripts/conformance.sh`
**and fix any errors it suggests.**

Once the script has completed successfully, it will print output similar to the
following:
```shell
INFO: Honeydew code has passed all of the conformance steps
```

This script will run the following scripts in same sequence:
1. [uninstall.sh](#un-installation)
2. [install.sh](#Installation)
3. [coverage.sh --affected](#code-coverage)
4. [format.sh](#python-style-guide)
5. [uninstall.sh](#un-installation)

### Installation
**Note** - Prior to running this, please make sure to follow
[Setup](interactive_usage.md#Setup)

**Running** `cd $FUCHSIA_DIR && sh $FUCHSIA_DIR/src/testing/end_to_end/honeydew/scripts/install.sh`
**will install Honeydew**

### Un-installation
**Running** `cd $FUCHSIA_DIR && sh $FUCHSIA_DIR/src/testing/end_to_end/honeydew/scripts/uninstall.sh`
**will uninstall Honeydew**

### Python Style Guide
**Run** `cd $FUCHSIA_DIR && sh $FUCHSIA_DIR/src/testing/end_to_end/honeydew/scripts/format.sh`
**and fix any errors it suggests.**

### Code Coverage
**Run** `cd $FUCHSIA_DIR && sh $FUCHSIA_DIR/src/testing/end_to_end/honeydew/scripts/coverage.sh`
**which will show comprehensive coverage on the entire Honeydew codebase.**

**For a targeted report on only the locally modified files, run the command**
**above with the `--affected` flag and fix any errors it suggests.**
