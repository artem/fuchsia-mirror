/// Trait used to indicate that the implementing type can be efficiently
/// converted into a reference to the original OpenThread type identified by
/// `Self::OtType`.
///
/// Types which implement this trait may be opaque, but, unlike [`Boxable`], these
/// types are not necessarily opaque and not necessarily ownable. If a type is
/// not opaque then it will also implement the related trait [`Transparent`],
/// allowing it to be used by value.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// This trait is unsafe because it is making an assertion about the
/// data's representation that must be verified by code review.
///
/// In order to safely implement this trait you must verify that the implementing
/// type is guaranteed to always be fundamentally identical in its in-memory
/// representation to `<Self as OtCastable>::OtType`.
///
/// For example, this would be the case if `Self` is `#[repr(transparent)]` and
/// has only a single member of `<Self as OtCastable>::OtType`.
