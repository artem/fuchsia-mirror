/// A box for owning pointers to opaque types vended from the OpenThread API.
///
/// May be abbreviated as an [`OtBox`](crate::OtBox) to avoid confusion with [`std::boxed::Box`].
///
/// Internally, an [`ot::Box`](crate::ot::Box) contains the raw pointer to the underlying
/// OpenThread object. Externally, the box appears to contain an instance
/// of a type implementing [`ot::Boxable`](crate::ot::Boxable). References to the
/// [`ot::Boxable`](crate::ot::Boxable) type are created from the underlying pointer as needed.
///
/// When an [`ot::Box`](crate::ot::Box) goes out of scope, the underlying object is finalized
/// according to the OpenThread API for that type, via
/// [`ot::Boxable::finalize`](crate::ot::Boxable::finalize).
///
/// The underlying pointer may be taken from the box without finalization
/// by calling [`ot::Box::take_ot_ptr`](crate::ot::Box::take_ot_ptr), which consumes the
/// [`ot::Box`](crate::ot::Box) and returns the pointer.
///
/// ## Safety ##
///
/// In general, the safety of this entire approach is dependent on the
/// following assumptions on the language itself:
///
/// 1. **Casting from pointers to references**: Transmuting a `*mut Self::OtType` to a `&Self` is
///    not itself undefined behavior assuming the pointer pointed to a valid object.
/// 2. **Casting from references to pointers**: Transmuting a `&Self` that was previously created
///    by assumption 1 back into a `*mut Self::OtType` will *always* yield the original pointer
///    value.
/// 3. **Behavior of Static Dispatch**: Traits implemented on `Self` and called via static
///    dispatch will have `&self` references that obey assumption #2.
/// 4. **No Spooky Stuff**: No weird pointer/reference manipulation happens behind the scenes,
///    like the spooky stuff C++ does.
