  // is set to true if a sequence was dropped due to a recombination error. The most likely causes
  // for an error are:
  //
  //   1. |fragment| contains a malformed L2CAP frame. A packet is treated as malformed if:
  //      a. Its suspected to be the first fragment in a new recombination sequence and does not
  //      contain a complete L2CAP basic header.
  //      b. After a recombination sequence is considered complete, the length of the frame does not
  //      match the length that was obtained from the L2CAP basic header.
  //
  //   2. |fragment| begins a new sequence when a prior incomplete sequence was in progress, in
  //   which case the incomplete sequence is dropped but |fragment| is retained UNLESS |fragment|
  //   itself constitues a malformed PDU (as in #1);
  //
  //   3. |fragment| is a continuing fragment that leaves the sequence in progress in a malformed
  //   state, in which case the sequence and |fragment| are dropped;
  //
  // A "true" |frames_dropped| value does not imply that the supplied input |fragment| itself was in
  // error and it is possible for |frames_dropped| to be true alongside a valid |pdu| value. The
  // caller can resume calling ConsumeFragment as normal, as the Recombiner can internally recover
  // from a recombination error.
