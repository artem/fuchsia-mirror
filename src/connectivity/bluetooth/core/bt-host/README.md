# bt-host

## Test

`$ fx test //src/connectivity/bluetooth/core/bt-host`

### Fuzz Testing

bt-host contains fuzz tests for several libraries. Make sure to include the desired fuzzing target
in your `fx set`. For example, to include all bt-host fuzzing targets, use:

```
fx set core.x64 --fuzz-with asan --with //src/connectivity/bluetooth/core/bt-host:fuzzers
```

Before running the test, ensure QEMU is running.

Run `fx fuzz list` to see the full list of available fuzzing targets. To run a specific fuzz test,
do `fx fuzz $package/$fuzzer` where `$package` and `$fuzzer` match those reported by `fx fuzz list`.



See the [fuzzing documentation](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/testing/fuzzing/overview?hl=en)
for a more in depth guide.

## Inspect

`bt-host` uses the [standard driver processes](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/57edce1df72b148c33e8f219bddbd038cdbb861b/zircon/system/ulib/inspect/) to expose its inspect hierarchy
to the Fuchsia system.

### Usage

To query the current state of the `bt-host` ***driver*** Inspect hierarchy through `ffx` tooling, run:

`ffx inspect show bootstrap/driver_manager --file class/bt-host/000.inspect`

To query the current state of the `bt-host` ***component*** Inspect hierarchy, run:

1. `ffx inspect list | grep bt-host` to find the component's `<moniker>`
2. `ffx inspect show "<moniker>"`
   - Note that the full moniker from step 2 should be in quotations
     - e.g., `ffx inspect show "core/bluetooth-core/bt-host-collection\:bt-host_000"`
   - Wildcards can be passed into the selector as needed
     - e.g., `ffx inspect show "core/bluetooth-core/bt-host-collection*"`
