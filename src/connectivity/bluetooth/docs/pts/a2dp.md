# A2DP PTS Instructions

## Setup
Source code setup:
* configure build to disable all external profile clients (sometimes called an "arrested" build)

Tools used to pass A2DP tests in PTS:
* `bt-avdtp-tool` (invoke before starting tests)
    * For SRC tests, invoke with the argument `-d 500`
    * For SNK tests, invoke with the argument `-d 0`
* `bt-cli` (invoke from device shell when specified in instructions)

## IXIT Values
* Use all defaults

## TESTS

### A2DP/SRC/AS/BV-01-I
1. PTS: `Is the test system properly playing back the media being sent by the IUT?`
