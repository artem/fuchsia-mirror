# `go_tracing_include_dirs` lists the directories where the C headers
# the tracing library includes locate.
# Any go_binary or go_test which depends on the tracing library needs to
# set it in `include_dirs`.
#
# For example,
#
# go_binary("foo_with_tracing") {
#   ...
#   include_dirs = go_tracing_include_dirs
# }

# TODO(https://fxbug.dev/42171960): public_configs doesn't work with go_library.
