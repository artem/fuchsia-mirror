// This component manifest shard is suitable for writing tests that verify
// delegated network provisioning, the provisioning of IPv4 connectivity by an
// agent other than Fuchsia.
//
// This test defines a netemul runner test realm that contains a hermetic
// network and two netstacks each with an endpoint to the network. On the
// "server side" runs a DHCPv4 server, and a bootstrap component to configure
// and enable the DHCPv4 server. On the client side is a test that waits to
// observe the client interface being assigned an address by the DHCPv4 server.
//
// This test can be run against either Netstack2 or Netstack3, by including
// either the `-with-ns2` or `-with-ns3` CML shard. To use those shards as part
// of a test, one will need to start a component that acts as a DHCP client, and
// route it capabilities from the client netstack.
