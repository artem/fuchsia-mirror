        // to `try_take` adds 0 or t in [1, 2) tokens.

        // Consider, for example, a production rate of 32 tokens per second and

        // - First, there are 32 tokens in the bucket.
        // - After 0.5 seconds, all 32 have been exhausted.
        // - The call to `try_take` which exhausts the bucket refills the bucket
        //   with 0.5 seconds' worth of tokens, or 16 tokens.
