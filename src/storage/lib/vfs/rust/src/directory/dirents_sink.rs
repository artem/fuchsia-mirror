    /// `Sink`/`Sealed` values via the trait.  But I could not find a way to express that.

    /// Seems like an associated type would express that, but if I add an associated type to both

    /// object safe, as long as they do not use their type arguments, which seems pointless, but
    /// here would be used to make sure that the type of the returned object is preserved.  Maybe
