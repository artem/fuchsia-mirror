//! This library is intended for contributions to the inspect library from clients. These are
//! patterns that clients identify in their usage of inspect that they can generalize and share.
//! Itâ€™s intended to be at a higher level than [`fuchsia-inspect`][fuchsia_inspect]. Some of the APIs
//! in this library might be promoted to the core library sometime in the future.
