# Wire types tests

These cover the construction and manipulation of C++ wire domain objects. Tests
generally should not require running client/server bindings, such that they are
more likely to work on both Fuchsia and host.

See //src/lib/fidl/llcpp/tests/conformance for testing the encoding and decoding
of these domain objects.
