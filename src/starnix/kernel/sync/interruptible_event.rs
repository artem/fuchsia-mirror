/// To block using an `InterruptibleEvent`, first call `begin_wait`. At this point, the event is
/// in the "waiting" state, and future calls to `notify` or `interrupt` will terminate the wait.

/// After `begin_wait` returns, call `block_until` to block the current thread until one of the
/// following conditions occur:
///
///  1. The given deadline expires.
///  2. At least one of the `notify` or `interrupt` functions were called after `begin_wait`.
///
/// It's safe to call `notify` or `interrupt` at any time. However, calls to `begin_wait` and
/// `block_until` must alternate, starting with `begin_wait`.

/// `InterruptibleEvent` uses two-phase waiting so that clients can register for notification,
/// perform some related work, and then start blocking. This approach ensures that clients do not
/// miss notifications that arrive after they perform the related work but before they actually
