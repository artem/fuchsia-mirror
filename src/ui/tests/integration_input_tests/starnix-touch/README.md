## Overview
This test exercises the touch input dispatch path from Input Pipeline to a Scenic client. It is a multi-component test, and carefully avoids polling for component coordination.
- It runs real Scene Manager and Scenic components.
- It uses a fake display controller; the physical device is unused.

### Components involved
- [starnix-touch-test.cc](starnix-touch-test.cc): Instantiates the component hierarchy,
  injects touch events, reads back events from the `evdev` client running under
  Starnix
- Scene Manager: Unmodified Fuchsia component; also referred to as Input Pipeline, for its
  role in routing input events
- Scenic: Unmodified Fuchsia component
- Starnix
  - [debian_realm](ui-client/meta/debian_realm.cml): The root of the Starnix subtree
    within the component hierarchy. Instantiates the Starnix kernel and the `debian_container`, and sets up the `starnix_kernel_env` needed for the Starnix kernel to be the runner for `debian_container`.

    All of this machinery lets us run software from a [Debian](https://debian.org) image.
    For details of which image is used, see the `debian_container_component` target
    in [ui-client/BUILD.gn](ui-client/BUILD.gn).

    This test uses the Debian image, because it's readily available in the Fuchsia
    tree. However, the test does not have any specific dependency on Debian, beyond
    the fact that Debian provides `.so` files needed to run a Linux C++ program.

    In particular, the test does not depend on, e.g., daemons in Debian that create
    device nodes in response to `udev` events.
  - [debian_container](ui-client/meta/debian_container.cml): The Linux userspace that
    is run by the Starnix kernel. This provides a shell environment (e.g. `/bin/sh`),
    runs the `launch_input` program to initialize Starnix input, and runs the
    `touch_dump` program to relay `evdev` data back to `starnix-touch-test.cc`.
  - [launch_input](ui-client/meta/launch_input.cml): This program triggers the
    initialization of Starnix input.
    - The C++ source code is trivial, as the main requirement is just to have some
      component that needs input, and keeps running.
    - The magic is in the CML file. By requiring the `framebuffer` feature,
      `launch_input` forces Starnix to initialize its input code.
    - When we refactor Starnix graphics and input, so that the `framebuffer`
      feature is associated with a kernel, rather than with components running
      under Starnix, this program can go away.
  - [touch_dump](ui-client/touch_dump.cc): The `evdev` client. This reads touch
    events from `/dev/input/event0`, parses the `struct input_event` records
    read from that device, and prints them out in a simple text format.

### Touch dispatch path
- `starnix-touch-test.cc` -> Input Pipeline -> Scenic -> Starnix kernel -> touch_dump

### Setup sequence
1. `starnix-touch-test.cc` sets up this view hierarchy:
   - Top level scene, owned by Scene Manager.
   - Child view, owned by Starnix.
1. `starnix-touch-test.cc` waits for a Scenic event that verifies Starnix has UI content
   in the scene graph.
1. `starnix-touch-test.cc` injects input into Input Pipeline, emulating a display's touch
   report.
1. Input Pipeline dispatches the touch event to Scenic.
1. Scenic dispatch the touch event to the Starnix kernel.
1. Starnix kernel receives the touch event from Scenic.
1. `touch-dump.cc` reads the event from the Starnix kernel using the `evdev` protocol.
1. `touch-dump.cc` reports the event details back to `starnix-touch-test.cc` over
   a Zircon datagram socket.
1. `starnix-touch-test.cc` validates the contents of the event.

### Capability routes
Here are some of the capability routes configured in this test. This is by no means
comprehensive. It just focuses on the routes that are apparent from the source
code in this directory.

### Synchronization
It's not clear what ordering guarantees exist regarding the initialization of Starnix input. With that in mind, there are a couple of synchronization risks that come to mind, and why they seem unlikely.

1. It might be possible for `touch_dump` to start execution before `/dev/input/event0`
   exists. This seems unlikely, because the work to create the device node is
   done synchronously at the time that a container launches:

   ```
   starnix/kernel/device/features.rs:run_container_features()
   -> s/k/d/input.rs:init_input_devices()
    -> s/k/d/input.rs:add_and_register_input_device()
     -> s/k/d/registry.rs:add_and_register_device()
      -> s/k/d/registry.rs:add_device()
       -> s/k/d/registry.rs:add_device_with_directory()
        -> s/k/d/registry.rs:devtmpfs_create_device()
         -> s/k/vfs/dir_entry.rs:create_entry()
          -> s/k/v/dir_entry.rs:create_entry_internal()
           -> s/k/v/dir_entry.rs:get_or_create_child() [DirEntry]
            -> s/k/v/dir_entry.rs:get_or_create_child() [DirEntryLockedChildren]
             -> [callback to lambda from devtmpfs_create_device()]
              -> mknod()
   ```

   If, however, we do encounter flake in opening the device node, we can probably work
   around it with a retry loop in `touch_dump`.

1. It might be possible for `touch_dump` to start execution before the relevant
   `InputFile` has connected to the `TouchSource` protocol from Scenic.

   This is because the `TouchSource` connection happens in response to the execution
   of `launch_input`, but there's no direct feedback from `InputFile` to the test
   logic that launches `touch_dump`.

   However, this also seems unlikely, because:

   1. Connecting to `TouchSource` happens synchronously in `run_component_features()`:
      ```
      starnix/kernel/device/features.rs:run_component_features()
      -> s/k/d/input.rs:start_relay()
      -> fidl::endpoints::create_proxy()
      ```
   1. `starnix-touch-test.cc` calls `LaunchClient()` before starting `touch_dump`.
   1. `LaunchClient()` connects to the `f.ui.app.ViewProvider` protocol served by
      `launch_input`.

   If, however, we do encounter flake in receiving touch events, we can probably
   work around it with a retry loop for `InjectInput()`.
