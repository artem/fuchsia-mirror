// This shard includes the portion of the a11y layer that is common
// across all production ui realms that include a11y, but differs from
// test ui realms.
//
// Production ui realms should include this shard directly.
//
// This shard should include:
//
// (1) A11y manager's child declaration. Note that other shards assume the
//     name "a11y_manager".
// (2) Capability routes to a11y manager that are the same for all production
//     ui realms in which a11y manager is present, but differ in test realms.
//
// This shard should **NOT** include:
//
// (1) Routes that are common to all production and test ui realms; these
//     routes belong in a11y_base_routes.shard.cml.
// (2) Routes to a11y manager that differ among production ui realms.
// (3) Routes **FROM** a11y manager to other components in the ui realm;
//     these routes belong in the target components' routing shards.
