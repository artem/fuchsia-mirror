# package_manager_test README

### What is this test about?

This is a set of tests for the package management workflow. It covers
commands done using `pm` and `pkgctl`.

In all, the tests cover the flow spanning from `*.far` and repo
creation to running binaries on-device from the served `*.far`.

See [packages](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/sdk/documentation/packages)
for more documentation.

Note that these tests may not function on products which have deprecated support for
writing blobs that are not RFC-0207 compliant.

### What are the corresponding smaller tests?

The individual tests can be found in `test/package_manager_test.dart`.

Relevant code paths with unit and integration tests:

```
//src/sys/pkg/tests/pkgctl
//src/testing/host-target-testing/packages
```

### What unique coverage does this E2E test provide?

These tests are mostly testing the actual commands (with the same
flags) that consumers were found using, so these tests are ensuring
we don't break our consumers.
