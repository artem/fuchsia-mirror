Wrapper layer that adds a sidecar to the test.json data with values needed by the
source_compatibility_test GN template. This is a workaround for the fact that:
* scopes cannot by dynamically modified in GN
* exec_script usage is discouraged.

This exists as a separate file to separate out GN specific data from the test
specification (test.json file), since this data is redundant.
