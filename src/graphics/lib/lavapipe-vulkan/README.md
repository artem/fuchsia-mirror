# Lavapipe ICD component

This directory defines two artifacts:

* A shared library ICD which provides a Lavapipe-based software Vulkan implementation
  * Currently this is a stub implementation, see https://fxbug.dev/42075795
* A component which makes this ICD available to the [Fuchsia Vulkan loader service][fuchsia-vulkan-loader],
  and therefore to Vulkan client apps.
  * The [Vulkan Loader RFC-0205][fuchsia-vulkan-loader-rfc] describes how the parts fit together.
