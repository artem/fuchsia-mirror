//! Minimal type-safe definitions of the virtio data structures.
//!
//! Contains definitions and type-safe accessors and manipulators of the virtio data structures.
//! For the leaf data structures like [descriptors](Desc) these definitions are simply the in
//! memory layout as a Rust `struct`.
//!
//! Unfortunately the virtqueues are a variable sized data structure, whose length is not known till
//! run time as the size is determined by the driver. Representing the virtqueue as 'just' a Rust
//! `struct` is therefore not possible.
//!
//! Two structs are used as for the representation as it allows for separating the
//! [`Device`] owned and [`Driver`] owned portions of the virtqueue into
//! separate portions with their correct mutability.
//!
//! Due to the split into the [`Driver`] and [`Device`] structs there is
//! no specifically named `virtqueue` in this module. The [Queue](crate::queue::Queue) builds on the
//! [`Driver`] and [`Device`] to build useful virtqueue functionality.
//!
//! These abstractions are intended to be type-safe, but not enforce correct implementation of the
//! virtio protocols. As such reading the [virtio specification]
//! (https://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.1/csprd01/virtio-v1.1-csprd01.html)
//! is required to correctly use this module. Most likely you do not want to use these directly and
//! want to use the higher level [`queue`](crate::queue), and [`chain`](crate::chain) modules that
//! provide easier to use wrappers.
