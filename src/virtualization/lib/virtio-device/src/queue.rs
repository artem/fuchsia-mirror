//! Virtqueue management wrappers.
//!
//! This is a slightly opinionated wrapper that presents the underlying [`Device`](ring::Device) and
//! [`Driver`](ring::Driver) rings as a single 'virtqueue' where descriptor chains can be retrieved,
//! walked or iterated, and then returned.
//!
//! The primary opinionated decision taken by this wrapper is that a descriptor chain is considered
//! a formal object that can automatically returns itself to the queue when dropped. This return is
//! then required to have a mechanism to potentially signal the guest driver, via the
//! [`DriverNotify`] trait.
