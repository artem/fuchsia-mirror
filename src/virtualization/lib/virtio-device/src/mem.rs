//! Structures for talking about memory shared between virtio devices and drivers
//!
//! Drivers, located in the guest, and devices, located in the host, operate with shared memory, but
//! may use different addresses to access it. All addresses published into the virtio data
//! structures are published by the driver and so refer to memory addresses as understood by the
//! driver.
//!
//! It is the responsibility of the host to know how to turn an address published by the driver,
//! a [`DriverRange`], into memory that can be ultimately be dereferenced and read/written to by
//! this device code, i.e. a [`DeviceRange`]. The [`DriverMem`] trait defines an interface for
//! performing this translation, although it is the responsibility of the application code to
//! provide and pass in implementations of this trait.
//!
//! [`DeviceRange`] is intended to describe valid ranges of memory that can be turned into pointers
//! through  [`try_ptr`](DeviceRange::try_ptr) and [`try_mut_ptr`](DeviceRange::try_mut_ptr) to
//! actually read and write.
