# Note: because numerous out-of-tree tests for JITs need executable memory,
# this policy is intentionally permissive, like the one for
# deprecated-ambient-replace-as-executable:
*

# That said, it is useful to try to at least keep inventory of what would need
# to be allowlisted if you wanted to make use of a more restrictive policy, so
# we enumerate some things below.  This list may not be exhaustive.
# Components that use VmexResource themselves
