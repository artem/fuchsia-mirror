  // will need to be enhanced in the future. It currently doesn't support several cases:
  //
  //  - On x64 and ARM collections <= 16 bytes are returned in registers:
  //
  //     - On ARM the collection is effectively memcpy'd into the registers and this should be
  //       straightforward to implement in the future.
  //
  //     - On x64 the allocation is more complicated and the collection members are taken apart and
  //       individually assigned to registers according to their type. This will be more difficult
  //       to implement in general, but we should be able to implement a one-element collection
  //       about as easily as the ARM case. This will give us some useful collections like
  //       smart pointers and handle wrappers.
  //
  //  - On ARM64 non-register collections are placed into memory indicated by the caller in x8 at
  //    the time of the function call. No information about this is guaranteed to be returned so
  //    we would need to indicate a saved register value.
