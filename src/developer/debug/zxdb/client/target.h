// A Target represents the abstract idea of a process that can be debugged. This is as opposed to a
// Process which corresponds to one running process.
//
// Targets are not initially attached to Processes on the debugged device. There are multiple ways
// of associating a Target with a Process.
//
// If users want to start a new process on the debugged device, they set the breakpoints, process
// name, command line switches, and other state in the Target.  The user then runs the target, which
// creates the associated Process object. When the process exits, the Target can be re-used to
// launch the process again with the same configuration.
//
// If users want to associate a Target with a process on the debugged device, they create a new
// Target (possibly using System::CreateNewTarget), and then call Attach() to perform the
// association.
