class Session;

// Entry point for sending zxdb events. This class is owned by the Session, and can be used from
// different contexts where interesting things happen. The goal of the API is to be as simple and
// unobtrusive as possible for the caller. There are no callbacks and no status reporting. Callers
// may safely fire and forget any event, and do not need to perform any checks for validity or
// enablement to call these methods.
//
// See the corresponding event definitions for more information about the parameters.
class AnalyticsReporter {
 public:
  AnalyticsReporter();

  // Explicitly initialize analytics reporting. This must be called before any of the reporting
  // methods will actually fire events. The session is sent with all events to the analytics client
  // implementation (see analytics.h), where the session is checked for validity. If an event
  // requires access to the Session object, it should be passed directly to that Event's respective
  // Report method.
  //
  // Explicit opt-in is chosen so that clients of this library that are not zxdb may simply ignore
  // this class and not impact zxdb's analytics. Other users of this library (symbolizer) would skew
  // other tools' data. The session is also manually constructed in many unittests, which should not
  // be reporting analytics.
  //
  // Note that this is separate from the user opt-in, which is handled by the analytics library.
