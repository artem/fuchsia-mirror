// This is a toplevel DWARF concept that contains all the different data types associated with the
// compilation unit like line tables and abbreviation tables. The main thing it contains is the
// Debug Information Entry (DIE) tree for the unit. This tree uses a root of DW_TAG_compilation_unit
// and is represented in our system by the CompileUnit class.
//
// These are similarly named so can be confusing, but this class is the higher-level construct.
