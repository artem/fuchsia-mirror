// Symbol interface for a Target. A target may or may not have a process, so this interface does not
// deal with anything related to addresses. See ProcessSymbols for that (which is most of the
// stuff).
//
// We can know about symbols associated with a target even when the process isn't loaded. For
// example, when setting a breakpoint on a symbol we can validate that it's a real symbol.
//
// The current implementation is that all modifications to the list of symbol modules is done by the
// ProcessSymbols which knows the actual symbols of the running program. This provides the minor
// benefit of symbols being available between identical runs of the same binary (useful for setting
// breakpoints).
//
// More useful would be that the symbols could be automatically loaded when we know the binary we'll
// be running, regardless of whether it's been started yet. This requires some system integration
// (how do you find the local binary for something on the target?) and may also depend on how
// typical programs will be started in the debugger (which may evolve).
