// this class itself is independent of load addresses, the functions take a SymbolContext which is
// used to convert between the absolute addresses use as inputs and outputs, and the module-relative
// addresses used by the symbol tables. The SymbolContext comes from the LoadedModuleSymbols which
// is owned by the ProcessSymbols object (which knows about the load addresses for each of its
// modules).

// via the CompileUnit.

  // binary, everything is in the same place and the two pointers will be the same. In the case of a
  // debug fission binary, the main_binary_unit will be the "skeleton unit" in the main binary,
  // while the details_unit will refer to the full symbols in the .dwo file.
