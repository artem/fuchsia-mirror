// Represents the type of a variable. This is a deserialized version of the various DWARF DIEs

//
// SYMBOL MEMORY MODEL
// -------------------
// Symbols are reference counted and have references to other Symbols via a LazySymbol object which
// allows lazy decoding of the DWARF data. These are not cached or re-used so we can get many
// duplicate Symbol objects for the same DIE. Therefore, Symbol object identity is not a way to
// compare two symbols. Even if these were unified, DWARF will often encode the same thing in each
// compilation unit it is needed in, so object identity can never work in DWARF context.
//
// This non-caching behavior is important to prevent reference cycles that would cause memory leaks.
// Not only does each symbol reference its parent, there are complex and almost-arbitrary links
// between DIEs that don't work well with the reference-counting used by symbols.
//
// A downside to this design is that we might decode the same symbol multiple times and end up with
// many copies of the same data, both of which are inefficient.
//
// The main alternative would be to remove reference counting and instead maintain a per-module
// mapping of DIE address to decoded symbols. Then links between Symbol objects can either be DIE
// addresses that are looked up in the module every time they're needed (lets the module free things
// that haven't been used in a while) or object pointers (avoids the intermediate lookup but means
// objects can never be freed without unloading the whole module). This scheme would mean that
// symbols will be freed when the module is removed, which will require weak pointers from the
// expression system.
//
// DIE ADDRESSES AND COMPILATION UNITS
// -----------------------------------
// In LLVM a DIE is indexed by its llvm::DWARFUnit and an offset within that. In contrast, our
// LazySymbols use a single global index which is converted to a unit/offset as needed. Once we
// decode a DIE, we don't need the offset at all, and we never needed the unit, so there are not
// available.
//
// If we find we need this information on each symbol in the future, it could be added. We would
// want to add some caching system since currently make duplicate DwarfUnit objects for the same
// LLVM One.
//
// Currently the DwarfUnit is accessible by waking up the tree to the CompileUnit. The CompileUnit
// stores a DwarfUnit pointer. Note that the CompileUnit is a DIE symbol while the DwarfUnit is the
// container for the CompileUnit and everything else associated with an object file. Many offsets
// in the symbols are relative to the DwarfUnit (note the main die_offset() is module-global).
class Symbol : public fxl::RefCountedThreadSafe<Symbol> {
 public:
  // Returns a lazy reference to this symbol. When creating LazySymbols, be sure not to store it
  // in such a way that it could create a reference cycle (so do not save it in any children of
  // this symbol or in anything it references).
  //
  // Note that we don't provide a GetUncachedLazySymbol() variant. That would be easy but is not
  // currently needed and it's potentially slightly dangerous. The uncached variants are used to
  // avoid reference cycles, but if we have a test object, it will contain a hard reference. The
  // tests use some helpers to clean this up safely (the SymbolTestParentSetter). Returning an
  // UncachedLazySymbol here may create the impression that it can be used in a "parent" context
  // while this would not be safe for test data.

  // GetLazySymbol(), see those for more).
  //
  // It would intuitively make the most sense for this to be set in the constructor since it's a
  // fundamental property of the symbol.
  //
  // The majority of symbols in production are created by the DwarfSymbolFactory, but the majority
  // of call sites that create symbols (by ~2 orders of magnitude) are tests. Defaulting the
  // factory/offset info and having a setter allows the DwarfSymbolFactory to set them while keeping
  // the test call sites cleaner.

  // parent of the function (for example, a class or namespace) rather than the one containing the
  // code. This is how callers can navigate the type tree but it means the parent won't match the
  // record in the DWARF file.
  //
  // For inline functions, it's important to know both the lexical scope which tells you the

  // inlined into. Function symbols have a special containing_block() to give the latter.
