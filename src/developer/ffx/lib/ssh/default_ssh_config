# Emulators start listening instantly, even though there is no sshd to talk
# to. And sometimes (?) they don't ever establish the connection. Give an
# emulator enough time to spin up, but timeout so we'll retry if need be.
# So, set the ConnectTimeout to 20 seconds, and try 3 times for a total of
# 60 seconds.

# Specifies the number of attempts to make before exiting.
ConnectionAttempts=3

# Specifies the timeout (in seconds) used when connecting to the SSH server,
# instead of using the default system TCP timeout.
ConnectTimeout=20

# Specifies interval for sending keepalive messages to the server.
# The messages are sent through the encrypted channel, and serve to
# detect if the server has crashed or the network has gone down.
ServerAliveInterval=1

# Sets the number of keepalive messages that may be sent by the client
# without the client receiving any messages back from the server.
# When this threshold is reached the client will terminate the session.
ServerAliveCountMax=10

# Specifies whether to send TCP keepalives to the other side. These operate on the level of the TCP protocol.
TCPKeepAlive=yes

# Specifies the verbosity level of logging messages from ssh.
# The possible values are:
# QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2, and DEBUG3.
LogLevel=ERROR

# If set to yes, passphrase/password querying will be disabled. This is useful for
# running the ssh client from shell script that do not have an interactive user,
# and prevents accidentally blocking on a password prompt.
BatchMode=yes

# Specifies whether the connection to the authentication agent will be forwarded
# to the remote machine.
ForwardAgent=no

# No X11
ForwardX11=no
ForwardX11Trusted=no

# Specifies whether to try rhosts based authentication with public key authentication,
# using the .rhosts or .shosts files in the user's home directory and
# /etc/hosts.equiv and /etc/shosts.equiv in global configuration.
HostbasedAuthentication=no

# Specifies that ssh should only use the identity keys configured in the
# ssh_config files, even if ssh-agent offers more identities.
# By setting no, it allows hardware keys like yubikey
IdentitiesOnly=no

# Specifies whether to use keyboard-interactive authentication. This is a common
# method for password authentication, one-time passwords, and multi-factor authentication.
KbdInteractiveAuthentication=no

# Specifies whether to try public key authentication using SSH keys.
PubkeyAuthentication=yes

# Specifies whether to verify the remote key using DNS
