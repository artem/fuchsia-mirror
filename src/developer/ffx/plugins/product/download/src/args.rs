    // Download core.vim3 of current ffx version.
    ffx product download core.vim3 ~/local_pb

    // Download core.vim3 with version 19.20240302.2.1
    ffx product download core.vim3 ~/local_pb --version 19.20240302.2.1

    Auth flow choices for --auth include:

      `--auth no-auth` do not use auth.
      `--auth pkce` to use PKCE auth flow (requires GUI browser).
      `--auth device-experimental` to use device flow.
      `--auth <path/to/exe>` run tool at given path which will print an access
        token to stdout and exit 0.
      `--auth default` let the tool decide which auth flow to use.
