    "The emu command is used to start up, manage, and shut down Fuchsia emulators.\n\nThe `start` subcommand launches an emulator according to the configuration in\nthe Product Bundle. Once one or more emulators are running, you can use the\n`list` subcommand to see the name and status of all running emulators, and the\n`show` subcommand to get a printout of the configuration for a specific\nemulator. When you're done with an emulator, use the `stop` subcommand to\ncleanly terminate that emulator.\n\nFor more information on the Fuchsia emulator, see the Getting Started page at\nhttps://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/get-started/set_up_femu."
