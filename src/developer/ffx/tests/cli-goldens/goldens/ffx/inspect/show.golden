Doesn't work if `--manifest`   is passed. - A tree selector, for example, `core/network/netstack:root/path/to/*:property` To learn more about selectors see https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/reference/diagnostics/selectors. The following characters in a selector must be escaped with `\\`: `*`, `:`, `\\`, `/` and whitespace. When `*` or other characters cause ambiguity with your shell, make sure to wrap the selector in single or double quotes. For example: `ffx inspect show \"bootstrap/boot-drivers:*:root/path/to\\:some:prop\"`",
