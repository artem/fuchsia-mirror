In this mode, the\nexposed, out, and runtime directories will not be accessible.\n\nWith --tools, tools in the specified package will be loaded into /.dash/tools/<pkg>/<binary>\nThe path is set so that they can be run by name. The path preference is in the command line order\nof the --tools arguments, with any built-in tools taking lowest priority.\n\n--tools URLs may be package or binary URLs. If a package URL is given, tool executables are expected\nto be in a bin/ dir within the package. If a specific tool URL is given, append the tool path\nto the package URL. For example: --tools fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/my_package#bin/my_tool. Note that\nnaming collisions can occur if multiple packages share a package or binary name. An error,\n`NonUniqueBinaryName`, is returned if a binary name collision occurs.\n"
