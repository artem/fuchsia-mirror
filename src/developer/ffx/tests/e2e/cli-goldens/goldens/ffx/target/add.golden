    "Manually add a target based on its IP address. The command accepts IPV4\nor IPV6 addresses, including a port number: `<addr> = <ip addr:port>`.\n\nTypically, the daemon automatically discovers targets as they come online.\nHowever, manually adding a target allows for specifying a port number or\naddress, often used for remote workflows.\n\nThis command will attempt to connect to the target in order to verify that RCS can\nbe used, allowing for typical FFX related workflows. If you do not wish to use\nthis, then you can run use the `--nowait` flag to return immediately. This can be\nuseful for debugging connection issues.\n\nIf you send SIGINT (Ctrl-C) to the command before the connection to the target is\nverified, the target will be removed. If RCS cannot be connected to (e.g. some\nconnectivity error is encountered), the target will also be removed.\n"
