  //
  // For now, a core codec has no way to trigger being asked for new input

  //
  // A decoder should permit a fairly wide range of buffer space, without
  // worrying whether the min is enough to efficiently handle a high bitrate.
  // The CodecImpl will own bumping up the min based on approximate bitrate
  // provided in the initial decoder creation parameters and/or per-stream input
  // format details (this logic is shared because it can reasonably be shared).
  // A core codec that has special requirements for extra input buffer space
  // given a particular bitrate can take it upon itself to set the input min
  // buffer space, but the idea is that typically it won't be necessary for a
  // decoder to increase the min based on input bitrate beyond what CodecImpl
  // does, so needing to do this should be fairly rare.
  //
  // A video encoder which needs to vary it's input BufferCollectionConstraints
  // based on encoder settings can do so, using the data provided to
  // CoreCodecInit().  If later use of QueueInputFormatDetails() (per-stream)
  // results in an input packet that conforms to the old
  // BufferCollectionConstraints but does not conform to the effective new
  // BufferCollectionConstraints, the core codec can use
  // CodecAdapterEvents::onCoreCodecFailCodec() (the core codec should fail the
  // codec instance in this case rather than attempt to handle input data that
  // is outside the bounds that would have been indicated by the core codec had
  // the current input format details been used as the initial format details).
  // Clients that change the input format details on the fly should be willing
  // to re-request a new codec instance at least once starting with the new
  // input format details via the CodecFactory.  This is true for additional
  // reasons beyond this paragraph involving the possibility of accelerated but
  // partial codec implementations.  If a client needs to change input format
  // details but doesn't want to concern itself with tracking whether the
