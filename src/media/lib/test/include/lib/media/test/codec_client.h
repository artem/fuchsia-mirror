// This class is just _a_ codec client, and should be read as an example only,
// and probably not a fully complete example either.  This class is just here
// to organize the code involved in setting up a Codec with input buffers and
// packets, feeding it input data in a single Stream, setting up the output
// buffers and packets, and ensuring that all input data is processed into
// output.
//
// A Codec client that wants to seek a logical stream or re-use a Codec to
// decode another logical stream would likely want to make more use of the
// stream_lifetime_ordinal to feed input data and to accept output data (vs.
// this example which has only one Stream lifetime which isn't visible outside
// this class. Re-using a Codec instance for a new stream is encouraged,
// especially when the output format isn't likely to change from stream to
// stream, which avoids re-configuring output buffers across the stream switch.
//
// The use of particular threads of execution to call this class is intended to
// clarify reasonable ordering and concurrency of messages sent and processed on
// the Codec interface.  There is no requirement that a Codec client use
// dedicated threads to achieve a permitted and useful ordering. The client does
// of course need to stay within the sequencing rules of the interface.
