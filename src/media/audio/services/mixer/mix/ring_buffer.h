namespace media_audio {

// Represents a single-producer multi-consumer ring buffer of audio data. A ring buffer represents a
// window into an infinite stream. Frame numbers are specified relative to this infinite stream --
// the translation into ring buffer offsets happens internally.
//
// ## Concurrency
//
// Code in this directory (`mix/`) is supposed to be single-threaded, but ring buffers are unusual.
// Ring buffers are concurrent by their very nature: the producer and consumer may be running in
// different threads, or even in different HW domains. Hence, all public methods in this class are
// safe to call from any thread, except `PrepareToWrite`, which must be called by the producer.
// The actual data in a ring buffer is synchronized by time, using one of two protocols, as
// described below.
//
// ### External producer or consumer
//
// If the ring buffer is shared with an external producer or consumer, such as a hardware device,
// then we divide the ring buffer into two adjacent regions: a "safe write" region, which the
// producer can write, and a "safe read" region, which the consumers can read. These regions meet at
// the current time: the "safe write" region is in the future while the "safe read" region is in the
// past. The producer and consumers must agree on these regions using some out-of-band mechanism.
//
// More information about this protocol can be found at the documentation for the
// `fuchsia.audio.RingBuffer` FIDL type.
//
// ### Splitters
//
// Each SplitterNode uses a RingBuffer to connect a source stream (which writes to the buffer) with
// one or more destination streams (which read from the buffer). SplitterNodes don't have a clean
// separation into "safe read" and "safe write" regions. In some cases, consumers are allowed to
// read from the same region the producer is writing to. See ../docs/splitters.h for a detailed
// description of this protocol.
