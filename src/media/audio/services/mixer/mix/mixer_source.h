// Class that manages relevant information of a `MixerStage` source to mix onto destination stream.
//
// This consists of the computation of the combined gain to be applied into the source stream, as
// well as processing the samples in the source stream to mix onto the destination stream using an
// appropriate sampler implementation with respect to the synchronization needs between the source
// and destination streams.
//
// Combined gain computation is done by using the set of `GainControl`s that are connected to the
// source, combined with the `GainControl`s that are connected to the destination. The source gain
// controls are selected during the creation of this mixer source edge, and are accessed by the
// `options.gain_ids`. Similarly, the initial destination gain controls are passed via
// `dest_gain_ids` at construction to build the total set of gain controls to be combined. However,
// while the source gain controls are guaranteed to remain constant after the edge creation, the
// destination gain controls can be modified after the creation of this mixer source. Therefore, we
// keep track of the destination gain controls and update them via `SetDestGains` as requested.
//
// Once the combined gain is computed and updated via `PrepareSourceGainForNextMix` call,
// corresponding source samples can be processed and mixed onto the destination stream via `Advance`
// and `Mix` calls. These mainly follow the same `PipelineStage::Advance` and `PipelineStage::Read`
// call patterns, where `Read` roughly expands to a sequence of `PrepareSourceGainForNextMix` and
// `Mix` calls respectively.
