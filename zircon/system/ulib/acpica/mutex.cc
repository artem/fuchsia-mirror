// The |acpi_spinlock_lock| is used to guarantee that all spinlock acquisitions will
// be uncontested in certain circumstances.  This allows us to ensure that
// the codepaths for entering an S-state will not need to wait for some other thread
// to finish processing.  The scheme works with the following protocol:
//
// Normal operational threads: If attempting to acquire a lock, and the thread
// holds no spinlock yet, then acquire |acpi_spinlock_lock| in READ mode before
// acquiring the desired lock.  For all other lock acquisitions behave normally.
// If a thread is releasing its last held lock, release the |acpi_spinlock_lock|.
//
// Non-contested thread: To enter non-contested mode, call
// |acpica_enable_noncontested_mode| while not holding any ACPI spinlock.  This will
// acquire the |acpi_spinlock_lock| in WRITE mode.  Call
// |acpica_disable_noncontested_mode| while not holding any ACPI spinlock to release
// the |acpi_spinlock_lock|.
//
// Non-contested mode needs to apply to both spin locks and mutexes to prevent deadlock.
// TODO(https://fxbug.dev/42159282): remove this, and replace it with a higher-level lock on the ACPI FIDL
// protocol. This is risky because pthread timeouts use CLOCK_REALTIME, which makes no forward
// progress in early boot.
