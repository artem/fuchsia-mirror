      //    value of the futex hasn't changed during this Wait operation. Acquiring this spinlock
      //    requires disabling interrupts. We do so explicitly with an `InterruptDisableGuard`
      //    instead of using the `IrqSave` option in the `Guard` because we acquire the thread lock
      //    later in this method, and we want IRQs to be disabled for this entire duration.

      // 4. Once validation is complete, we observe the "core thread" of the proposed new owner.
      //    This is the Thread* member of the ThreadDispatcher.  If there is still a valid proposed
      //    new owner, we will obtain the dispatcher's "core thread" lock, which will ensure that
      //    the underlying Thread cannot exit even after we drop the ThreadDispatcher lock.
      // 5. Next, we can obtain the set of ChainLocks needed to block the thread an assign our
