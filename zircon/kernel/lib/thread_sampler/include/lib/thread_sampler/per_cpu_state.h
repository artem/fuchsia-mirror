namespace sampler::internal {

// When we start sampling, we assign and pin a VmObject buffer to each CPU for it to write on. We
// also assign a per cpu timer. When the timer triggers, we mark a thread to write a sample to the
// buffer. When the thread will at some point in the future when it is safe to do so, write a
// sample.
//
// This creates the main problem: how do we safely clean up when we stop? If we are handling a stop
// request on one core, it's not safe to immediately clean up the buffers since another core could
// be writing a sample or could be scheduled to write a sample. To do this safely, we have a three
// phase shutdown:
//
// 1) Disable new writes and new timers
// 2) Cancel existing timers and wait for any lingering timers to clear out
// 3) Wait for any in progress writes to stop
//
// Now it's safe to destroy our state.
//
// So then, each cpu state also contains an atomic variable with 3 bits: a writes enabled bit, a
// pending write bit, and a timer pending bit. When a cpu wants to write, it atomically checks if
// the write enabled bit is set, and if so, sets the pending write bit and checks the write-enabled
// bit again before proceeding. When it is done, it resets the pending write bit, ignoring the
// writes enabled bit.
//
// The timer callback receives a pointer to the PerCpuState and the timer pending bit ensures that
// the per cpu state lives longer than the timer callback.
//
// Now, when we want to clean up, on each cpu, we reset the writes enabled bit, knowing that no new
// pending writes or timers can start. We then wait for the pending write bit and pending timer bit
// to reset on each cpu. Only then do we know that no additional writes will occur.
