// This defines some layouts and constants for the Linux/x86 Boot Protocol,
// described in https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/x86/boot.html; this
// file uses the struct and member names in that document, which reflect the
// <asm/bootparam.h> code in the Linux kernel's public headers, but placed in
// the `linuxboot` C++ namespace.  Ony the subset needed by the shim code
// implemented for Zircon is included here.  More can be added as necessary.
namespace linuxboot {

// This is the primary protocol data structure that the boot loader reads and
// writes.  Its placement in boot_params (below) puts the `jump` member at
// exactly 512 bytes from the start of boot_params, which is at the start of
// the whole bzImage file.  The boot loader first loads the first 512-byte
// sector, so it can see just boot_params up through `hdr.boot_flag`.
//
// The boot loader then checks `header`, `version`, and `boot_flag` to validate
// the precise protocol it should be using.  In the versions we support, then
// it consults `loadflags` and `syssize` for more details and those tell it
// which fixed load address to use for the main kernel image, and how big it is
// (in 16-byte units).  As `loadflags` is past the first 512 bytes, the boot
// loader always reads at least one more sector.  Whether it reads more than
// that depends on which booting path it's going to use.  In either path, it
// loads the main kernel at the fixed load address indicated by the version and
// loadflags; for bzImage format it's always 1MiB.
//
//  * Direct 32-bit entry ignores the rest of the setup area.  It allocates a
//    new boot_params struct somewhere and first zeros the whole thing.  Then
//    it copies just the setup_header region from the original image into that
//    boot_params::hdr, and modifies various fields in setup_header and other
//    parts of boot_params to pass information to the kernel.  Finally it
//    simply jumps to the fixed load address indicated by the setup_header
//    flags, in 32-bit protected mode.  The %esi register holds the physical
//    address of the setup area (i.e. `boot_params*`).  The %esp register
//    points to some usable stack space.
//
//  * 16-bit entry uses the rest of the setup area that 32-bit entry ignores.
//    It looks at setup_header::setup_sects for a count of 512-byte sectors to
//    read after the first.  That whole "setup area" from the beginning of the
//    image up through the total size `(hdr.setup_sects + 1) * 512` is loaded
//    at some arbitrary 4KiB-aligned address, hence the moniker "zero page".
//    Then it simply jumps to 512 bytes into the setup area, in 16-bit real
//    mode.  The %cs segment points to this directly, so the entry point is at
//    %cs:0.  The %ds and %es segments point to the start of the setup area, so
//    %ds:0 (i.e. `%ds << 4`) is the boot_params object.  The %ss:%sp points to
//    some usable stack space.  The boot loader fills in a few essential fields
//    but not as much as the 32-bit entry protocol would.  The 16-bit entry
//    code is responsible for discovering more on its own and is expected to
//    rely on the legacy PC 16-bit BIOS ABI.  Traditionally, it allocates a new
//    boot_params struct of its own and copies setup_header and other data into
//    it to pass along to the 32-bit entry point so it looks like the direct
//    32-bit entry from a boot loader would.
