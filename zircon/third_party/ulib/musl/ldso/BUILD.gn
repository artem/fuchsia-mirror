  # riscv on dynlink.c. Under asan-ubsan instrumentation, the dynamic loader
  # already uses a lot of stack and we're somewhat close to the limit. Using
  # vector instructions decrements the stack a bit more and pushes us below the
  # limit leading to stack overflows. In the long run, the new dynamic linker
  # may alleviate some of this and we can re-enable it then. It's probably
  # better to keep sanitizer instrumentation here over vector instructions.
