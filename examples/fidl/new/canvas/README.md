# README

This directory contains all of the example code for the "canvas" series of FIDL
examples. See the associated [docs][docs] for more information.

Each example should include the following:

* The [FIDL][impl-fidl] definition.
* The [CML][impl-cml] definitions for the client and server.
* The [realm][impl-realm] definition for performing end-to-end testing.
* An [implementation][impl-cpp-natural] of the client and server using the C++ (Natural) bindings.
* An [implementation][impl-cpp-wire] of the client and server using the C++ (Wire) bindings.
* An [implementation][impl-hlcpp] of the client and server using the HLCPP bindings.
* An [implementation][impl-rust] of the client and server using the Rust bindings.
